we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ var@@ ies inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has te@@ stes inside , and she has a y chromo@@ some .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , frank@@ ly , sc@@ are them .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
ultimately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always trans@@ formed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
and so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor tony , temp@@ t , and his cause .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
so western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extin@@ ction , water and energy shor@@ tage -- we sur@@ ely do .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
so even while studying , you deal with the top@@ ic of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
but i do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the mal@@ ay@@ si@@ an coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
it &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
in h@@ oll@@ and it &apos;s easier to understand this , because h@@ oll@@ and built the country on flo@@ wers .
this is true . i believe this .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
no , they didn &apos;t demo@@ li@@ sh it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappe@@ ars .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els .
now today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing power of networks , to the physical one .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel actually .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve sei@@ tz at u.@@ w .
if i asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but somehow it wasn &apos;t really well received there .
and they are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , individuals .
it really comes from these artists .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conc@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of this talk .
people are always up@@ set when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
and i don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all h@@ arb@@ or@@ ed as children .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of c@@ ameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone c@@ ameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environment .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are conne@@ cting to the global conversation .
so that &apos;s occu@@ py@@ thes@@ e@@ c movement has done .
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vi@@ ral and then why that even matters .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to act as if the first theor@@ em were fal@@ se from the start , so of course you &apos;d have accept the opposite without any pro@@ of .
i was a resi@@ dent at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto when mr@@ s. dru@@ cker was brought to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital where i was working .
according to bur@@ r@@ elles , the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered in janu@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
they divi@@ ded the entire king@@ dom in half .
and the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but i see this kid .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
somebody broke in and they ha@@ cked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ il@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
there &apos;s no problem with over@@ population among trees .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
they &apos;re ob@@ sc@@ ure , weird programs .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
in h@@ oll@@ and we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ ghter swa@@ ying the trees .
but when i cho@@ se a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
we are talking here about , o@@ f@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the wheel@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
she would catch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since laun@@ ch .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked ja@@ m for our experiment .
what are some other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life .
slowly but sur@@ ely , it li@@ f@@ ted .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pus@@ hing them more towards failure .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or both .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characteri@@ zed by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
it &apos;s entirely in@@ significant .
i represent people on death row .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to .
she was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world .
i want to ask a question .
i &apos;m just going to very brie@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody sus@@ pe@@ cted anything .
so to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
and i did well , i gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , c@@ um lau@@ de .
i worked in the collective for el@@ even years , it was based on a gras@@ s@@ roots democracy .
he was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over .
and as of today , we would like to introdu@@ ce this , not only as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ e@@ u , which is what the product is called , but also a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and with that you can acceler@@ ate the particles stron@@ g@@ ly enough and then they enter the oni@@ ons .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle c@@ ry .
je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take g@@ ary up on his offer .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
but we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adverti@@ ser would normally never get behind .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
so again , that was a real good match .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ?
i fell out of love with this fish .
now when i was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , i took my first biology class .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
and secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it ada@@ pt to us as well as we ada@@ pt to it .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
this means that the interpre@@ ter must trans@@ late these im@@ pre@@ cise indi@@ cations in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al musical language .
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
we had to take them out , which we did .
are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
the result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
maybe we can see it as change .
and as a con@@ sequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we &apos;ve had before .
and they were always magni@@ fi@@ cent , because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
sh@@ am@@ ans , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-@@ called kee@@ pers of knowledge , were speci@@ ally as@@ sig@@ ned to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
how do i get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gra@@ ce note .
and si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
you know , you can choose your list .
and similar to &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
we use our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
we type , we fi@@ le , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an is .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
there are billions of them .
yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contra@@ cts in summer .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of h@@ h@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee en@@ em@@ as .
so what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
and the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations sha@@ ping a new life together .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ as@@ h@@ can behind the house .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
spa@@ tial reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
photos like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
for the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar-@@ gener@@ ated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity in india -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
no apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
but what this image represents was the problem .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re dec@@ ei@@ ving yourself .
so this is for real .
and we can see that it can be done .
every bit of waste is a nutri@@ ent .
made all these films , made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary films for a very limited audience .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great ap@@ es .
for example perception in this context .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
and i always have been .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
so , i &apos;m going to wra@@ p up now .
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
she li@@ kes him a lot , because he has the tenden@@ cy to be for@@ th@@ right .
you no longer need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a song .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
in fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
maybe 10 times more .
over@@ view : i &apos;m inter@@ acting with the object so to speak , can zo@@ om back out , zo@@ om in .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
we have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences i wanted to men@@ d , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
the dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gra@@ y box if a specific con@@ figu@@ ration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct is actually running on that target .
i have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
is that all ?
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all@@ -@@ expen@@ s@@ es@@ -@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
and we &apos;re just trying to demon@@ strate that we can de@@ cre@@ ase the capac@@ i@@ ties , the mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties , by putting electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the network too .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , fro@@ ze the s@@ wis@@ s bank account of mr. sam ja@@ in right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
we need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
it sounds sc@@ ary .
but nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and in this mind they had memory .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back@@ -up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quanti@@ ties .
here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
what would you say ?
and instead of p@@ ani@@ cking , he just stopped .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice stat@@ ements were made , which i also was part of .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , when defen@@ ding his prote@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ a@@ day -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ulti@@ mate , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
and here was myself trying not to get we@@ t , testing the sensor@@ s that open the water .
and what i realized is i needed an exper@@ t .
and if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energy , we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as te@@ sti@@ cles -- and also how play both requires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , i want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a y chromo@@ some , meeting that x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
and the more can@@ di@@ dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
in the inter@@ val , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
and this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in janu@@ ary .
so no more zer@@ os and ones with cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but a metaphor .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; they demo@@ li@@ shed the building . &quot;
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and trou@@ bled children caught between two worl@@ ds .
so i think we from the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the acade@@ mic world .
and he dre@@ w again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate .
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
yeah . all right .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
so these are just small ta@@ sters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
so a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o previ@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ roll@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
he answers the door .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal be@@ have quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to ki@@ ck out all the other pas@@ sen@@ gers .
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaning@@ ful work .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
the so , music fun@@ ctions a lot like spo@@ ken language in my opini@@ on .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
my circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o where i was the class que@@ er .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ re@@ ment plans .
that &apos;s just about the minim@@ um .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
so now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently invest@@ ing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magni@@ tude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;@@ am , i do . &quot;
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fi@@ ction influence , as a kid .
so we &apos;re not battery manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
that &apos;s why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteri@@ stic that can &apos;t be learned .
so go ahead and start inv@@ enting .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started argu@@ ing .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours m@@ s. par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
the other one had a lot of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
you see , sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resour@@ ce-@@ liber@@ ating force .
i think b@@ ach would have been very enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic if he &apos;d had the ton@@ al possibilities that today &apos;s modern pian@@ os have .
mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
the conclu@@ sion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by machin@@ ery .
that &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times che@@ aper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
there &apos;s been this huge dec@@ line in crime in america over the last three decades .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ as@@ h@@ can . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titude of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can p@@ lot our brain .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the promise of the children ?
i approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portra@@ its of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ var@@ ies is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
turned tr@@ as@@ h@@ can on its side . walked home .
i see this plus sign .
i think my personal story is expla@@ ined very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ t@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
if you are a sus@@ pe@@ ct in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be ta@@ pped .
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the god .
not surpris@@ ingly , this destruction also en@@ dan@@ gers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
when i say re@@ alism , i mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , collea@@ gue universi@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these a@@ e@@ ds all around the world .
now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensor@@ s -- so for example , from pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke input data .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essen@@ ce of the i@@ ter@@ ative process .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms were turning into multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms .
it has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise i won &apos;t convince my audience that this is my desire .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
an entire re@@ mix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
they dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
we will have them ge@@ ared for both male or female -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
and all the while , i was a@@ mas@@ sing more and more knowledge .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
i &apos;m a day older , the seas@@ ons change , my pul@@ se is slo@@ wer in the ev@@ ening than it is in the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall it takes longer for the rever@@ ber@@ ation to return than it does at home .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
that &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from c@@ elli@@ sts .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fir@@ es when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
if i had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , i would have put it into a virus and rele@@ ased it in the room .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
and you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ c@@ tors .
that &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ cre@@ te block .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te than if you only offer five . why ?
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
i sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
so the white lines here are population .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; and see .
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive wild@@ card .
after only one trip .
you probably saw it on the news .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
the mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birth@@ right .
and we actually build stron@@ ger social relationships as a result .
we &apos;ve tried various approach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal components .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
and it all conne@@ cts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change oc@@ curr@@ ing in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstra@@ cting out .
it was worth lo@@ cking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of metal and you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
but this is also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
the next generation of graphic user inter@@ faces already works with behavi@@ our a lot more .
and because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the pa@@ pers is what you find in this third theor@@ em .
this is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
30 years ago that would have so@@ unded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
and the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
how and what did they feel ?
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
it was really , really quite profound .
that &apos;s a funny oc@@ curr@@ ence , you know .
they then also say , why ?
if i &apos;m not right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is not a man .
and ultimately , we have to embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency .
you could also use conven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for spre@@ ading .
the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because bacteria communicate .
i gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on everyone &apos;s humanity .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epidemic of autis@@ m to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine shot .
there &apos;s already a rather impres@@ sive number of people worldwide .
because they changed their cha@@ ir@@ man of the board of direc@@ tors twice now .
if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct , and it took months to understand how to hand@@ le these systems .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropriate .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h-@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about sla@@ very .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut fore@@ sts .
and they noticed that the city never gets to dig@@ ging out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- i &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
next would be nuclear .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expedi@@ tions .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net and che@@ cked this thing out .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ m@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing .
serve food at a sou@@ p kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to ada@@ pt to an increasingly challen@@ ging world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
how much money does it take to do this ?
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qu@@ ish@@ es human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
all along , all fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic .
i was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
so that started the journey .
we design unique elements into this .
what if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate the diabetes , elimin@@ ate the he@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
but play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resol@@ ution experience .
and you can inje@@ ct these sounds into a sequence that you can assem@@ ble into the pattern that you want .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he asked me what the pre@@ am@@ ble to this bal@@ la@@ d was in my opini@@ on .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their streng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
every foot@@ print is dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ge@@ ous there .
and a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
and in this other image at the top i have a lec@@ ture in in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical mus@@ ei@@ on in combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the top@@ ic .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
given all of that , mistakes are inevi@@ table .
and because they work so much harder physi@@ cally than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amo@@ unts to that of thir@@ ty billion people .
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year through the code for america program .
in one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufacturing de@@ fe@@ ct .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sen@@ ti@@ ments of george bur@@ ns , who was per@@ forming still in las v@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s .
we find other kinds of wei@@ r@@ dness in terms of what their rights are .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fi@@ cs , with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ fe .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
introdu@@ ce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spa@@ tially in this way .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen ac@@ tively ?
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s arch@@ a@@ ic . how can that be ? &quot;
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allo@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m the trends man@@ ager at youtube , and i profession@@ ally watch youtube videos .
so you don &apos;t lose ab@@ und@@ ant animals .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
and they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better educ@@ ated by using the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by literally being able to use 3d prin@@ ting and infin@@ ite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
make it possible , everyone in this room .
so , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
because it &apos;s a tra@@ v@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
it &apos;s the first biological ru@@ ck@@ s@@ ack , truly , that was made to be re@@ turned into the life cycle .
i &apos;m totally with you .
ad@@ ver@@ sity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
and they will con@@ test this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medi@@ cations to re@@ lie@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
i had a lot of journ@@ alists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk a@@ verse , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be reward challen@@ ged .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had .
they can have stron@@ ger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
computer ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s yes , ha@@ ck@@ ers break into a place and ste@@ al data and so on .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many direc@@ tions .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so eng@@ aging , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ality .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn &apos;t at all , they &apos;re actually equ@@ ally big , and yet our perception changes , depen@@ ding on the context we place things in .
alone , as@@ ham@@ ed and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
mon@@ day : color is powerful .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b@@ .@@ s .
i realized at that point , by conne@@ cting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people ele@@ cted to office .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 50@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
and it turns out that making it feel more con@@ cre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , dou@@ bled demand and things like that .
so you can re@@ constru@@ ct a whole movement .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with te@@ stes who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
but if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
why not have the quick wi@@ t of a ken jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
so how do people die as the result of a ha@@ ck like this ?
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ a@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
so ants wei@@ gh more than we do .
the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .
they use online attac@@ ks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
and we built an i@@ pad app@@ lic@@ ation .
how many would op@@ t for memory ?
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it res@@ on@@ ate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs brought her back to the emergen@@ cy department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sever@@ e sho@@ ck .
i never knew him in real life .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
and we went to school distri@@ cts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h-@@ stra@@ pped schools all across america .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
and then he says three words -- the most un@@ emotional three words i &apos;ve ever heard .
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accor@@ d@@ ingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please b@@ low up . &quot;
what other br@@ ands are like that ?
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly as@@ s@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
here you see a sam@@ ple of this actual attack code .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
that means they navi@@ g@@ ated through the use of sound and rhyth@@ m .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
in israel people say , if you save a human life , you &apos;re saving the world .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fix@@ ed them .
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build c@@ ameras and lights and all kinds of things .
protect the environment , consu@@ me less energy .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imag@@ ined .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
but still it was a real foot@@ race against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
you could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it contra@@ cts in summer .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
why didn &apos;t i ask my atten@@ ding ? why did i send her home ?
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensor@@ s colle@@ cting information from the car , trans@@ mit@@ ting this information into the system , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
and we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
but now , because the refle@@ ctive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing like my own personal tre@@ as@@ ure h@@ unt .
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dra@@ matic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intelle@@ ct and reason .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of e@@ den .
and actually i become a character in the book .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the in@@ her@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
were you ever en@@ vi@@ ous ?
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
then i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
the categ@@ ories need to say something to the choo@@ ser , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
so , here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reaction .
so whereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to fig@@ uring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inje@@ cted more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and i tried something interesting .
i was raised in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia to believe those fore@@ sts exi@@ sted to be cut .
and of course that &apos;s something where you start and look and say , okay , let me look into the inner self .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ ni@@ ty .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative partici@@ p@@ ating communities , complete un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness , these are characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popul@@ ar@@ ity .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
so , you don &apos;t ab@@ sta@@ in from food just because you can &apos;t co@@ ok .
something as dra@@ matic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
but the nin@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the nin@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative approach@@ es .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
in fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
she was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our family .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
if you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
and it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
i &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
and in a mira@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ sohn , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
gr@@ ants and spon@@ sor@@ s were sou@@ ght .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
and as we &apos;re here in frank@@ fur@@ t am main , i &apos;ll re@@ mind you of the ma@@ x -@@ plan@@ ck@@ -@@ institute for brain research .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ stra@@ cted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
is that your opini@@ on ?
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
what they re@@ je@@ cted was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
the com@@ pos@@ er increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
so even with that ca@@ ve@@ at , i knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named er@@ ik micha@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neuro@@ marketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mr@@ i &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commer@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
and now we &apos;re going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we &apos;re really in this in this phenomen@@ al phase at the moment , the fact that we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it .
i play to explain what these t@@ ones might have meant .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for temp@@ t to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again ? well that would be a@@ wes@@ ome . &quot;
well , since the film pre@@ mi@@ ered at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , let &apos;s take a look .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
now there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the usa who &apos;s trying to produce bio@@ fuel , bio@@ dies@@ el fuel made from al@@ ga@@ e .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
now that &apos;s more impres@@ sive when you consider those magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into understanding , a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and gra@@ ce .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of this aspe@@ ct in our narra@@ tives of human evolution .
i looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simpli@@ fying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of pos@@ ing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
as an interpre@@ ter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natu@@ re-@@ et@@ -@@ pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s or whatever they &apos;re all called , that per@@ mit@@ s our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to be put back into the cycle .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
come on .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in febru@@ ary last year .
and we keep setting our expec@@ tations higher and higher .
so two cou@@ ples each conc@@ ei@@ ving one baby .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
and it creates this kind of social network around a colle@@ ction of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt out@@ put and can keep up that out@@ put for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
this idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
here we have a very basic service : do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ?
do you realize that we can take advantage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machin@@ ery of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of human insu@@ lin used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ?
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
you take them away , disease comes back , horri@@ ble diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the se@@ c &apos;s requ@@ est for com@@ ment on the financial re@@ form bill .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
it caused im@@ men@@ se celebra@@ tion in the control room .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
i was be@@ tting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
em@@ c pres@@ ents : &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency . &quot;
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r who was the organi@@ zer of the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , repres@@ ented dr. king .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gress .
this is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
and in that time you can re@@ act differently .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges in iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
and these women would get together and just talk .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , h@@ d video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagno@@ stic technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and demon@@ e@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ phone .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
let &apos;s call him don too .
and you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ place .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
fe@@ ast@@ ing ? i was totally conf@@ used .
some of you might remember , it was it@@ al@@ y and fr@@ ance playing , and then zi@@ dan@@ e at the end , the head@@ bu@@ tt .
when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
and as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpli@@ stic .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpo@@ ration , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be .
this mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fis@@ hed .
so what could three billion ris@@ ing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be enga@@ ged .
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
so those are the three main attac@@ kers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , ha@@ ck@@ tivi@@ sts like anony@@ mous doing it for the pro@@ test , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attac@@ ks .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many do@@ ors there are .
one of the interesting impli@@ cations on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , like po@@ uring a color the way we might po@@ ur a liquid .
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
well she was back all right .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ ells good , too .
i could see in her eyes , it was ter@@ ror . life was over .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
and my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ cked my so@@ cks off .
temp@@ t &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty a@@ wes@@ ome .
the brand that i am is , i would call it cas@@ ual fly .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
today a modern orche@@ str@@ a can play anything that was re@@ je@@ cted as un@@ play@@ able at the time .
i decided that rele@@ asing fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
i have talked about four techniques for mi@@ tig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
remember those na@@ pp@@ ies again ?
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do obje@@ c@@ tively better .
but one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is head@@ ing toward ?
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soc@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
that all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
in the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
the l@@ oud and soft sym@@ b@@ ols , f and b , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is brand@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these a@@ e@@ ds .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fi@@ ction fan .
so this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not contain@@ ed within any one wikipedia page .
what takes tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five milli@@ seconds ?
that &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe trick .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
in the united states , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ cker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sau@@ lt me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
in the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ v@@ ators .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you fe@@ eding ? &quot;
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embra@@ ce fear .
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also mani@@ fest@@ ed itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscop@@ e .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ fer to do it all in ger@@ man , because if i &apos;d have to trans@@ late it into english , that would be like the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
they spe@@ ared each other .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
my mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
we took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the home@@ ow@@ ner than@@ king us for the v@@ ali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
i became en@@ am@@ or@@ ed of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
a woman in germany s@@ wal@@ lo@@ ws about six point three kil@@ os of li@@ p@@ stick in her lifetime .
one is south korea .
we actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ air@@ es online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ air@@ es , who made money with their attac@@ ks .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a time of fam@@ ine .
and one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles : as natural as possible , as intui@@ tive as possible , but also with complete transpar@@ ency .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
four and a half thousand people live there .
so an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , is born three months pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely , so she &apos;s born on jun@@ e 1 , 19@@ 80 .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the con@@ vol@@ ution program right before your eyes .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ po@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
we &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the admini@@ stration of crimin@@ al justice .
because if you just read about it in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
it is actually the true integra@@ tion of the man and the machine .
play &apos;s a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quie@@ t , imag@@ in@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ e@@ w .
it &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
in fact , so l@@ ac@@ king in confidence was i that i actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
fe@@ min@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism . &quot;
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
they put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
and she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
so in dec@@ ember we met in mi@@ ami , in a hotel conference room .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers . &quot;
and it got to the essen@@ ce , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the waste quite dra@@ matically as you &apos;re going through this process .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 193@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
one , we bat@@ ter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the in@@ sur@@ ance companies , and we actually got temp@@ t a machine that let him communicate -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
well in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secret police in apri@@ l 2011 , and when they were lo@@ ot@@ ing the building they found lots of pa@@ pers .
and i went back to work .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
the du@@ tch government has st@@ ated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experiences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follo@@ ws quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
when a child gro@@ ws up in an environment where the adults ac@@ tively make music or at least ac@@ tively li@@ stens to music , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flo@@ wer ?
so for example , the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technologi@@ cal innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
in fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
and there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counter@@ parts , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
but tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pres@@ sing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
this is my wi@@ f@@ i scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terri@@ tory , doing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little c@@ up of coffee or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
if you just take these these na@@ pp@@ ies , sh@@ red them , ster@@ ili@@ ze them and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees with it .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that i believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
he only has use of his eyes .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i , part broo@@ kl@@ yn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
we find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
this is an example of how adults in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
it &apos;s a lot .
we can see that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
so not saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
only i think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ tee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
so back in the day , when us indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
so , the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the creation of many mira@@ cles .
you st@@ are out at a hori@@ zon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this thi@@ ck , rich mar@@ s@@ hl@@ and .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
i get the entire over@@ view , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we gu@@ ard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accor@@ d@@ ingly .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
cat@@ s were watching other cat@@ s watch this video .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a us@@ b stick , as we saw it in the case of stu@@ x@@ net .
now nei@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ com@@ men@@ d for people when you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-@@ called state tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
and we set up a proje@@ ctor on a wall out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hospital .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water t@@ ank , inside , so they can go back to a cell@@ u@@ lose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fif@@ ty trees in israel or tun@@ isi@@ a with one baby .
and it &apos;s that play@@ ful curi@@ osity that dri@@ ves us to explore , dri@@ ves us to interact , and then the un@@ expected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
hal@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sen@@ sor and an actu@@ ator .
and those that were like that started to spli@@ t and divi@@ de .
but that &apos;s the ni@@ c@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us rather than having a geni@@ us .
we went and looked at a site .
i &apos;ve brought along a project i &apos;d like to introdu@@ ce to you .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , colle@@ cted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satelli@@ te images and so on , but from the collective memory .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
over the course of this film , we had 50@@ 0-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
some people who have x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ est@@ is , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with te@@ sti@@ cular tissue wra@@ pped around it .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attac@@ ks based on the attac@@ kers .
what kind of an idea is it to think about insi@@ sting that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents ?
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this jan@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and forth .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
there are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her k@@ nee jo@@ in@@ ts , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ oth and very natural ga@@ it .
that means we &apos;re losing five-@@ thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
the idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
i commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
i once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young collea@@ gue , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and as@@ hes , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the cultural revolution .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
and that scienti@@ fically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly cor@@ rect , because because we don &apos;t know how much is k@@ is@@ sed away .
every single thing we eat , every grain of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
of those have you ever heard of over@@ population of trees ?
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
their brain waves were then measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the ro@@ om@@ went swi@@ t@@ ched on .
and then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
something sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
and on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cra@@ ck in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and i wonder@@ ed , maybe i could feel better again .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like so@@ jour@@ ner truth talking about , &quot; a@@ in &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
i had this en@@ counter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virg@@ ini@@ a , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the landscape .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to court and pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
the same technology that has produced the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but indu@@ ce imm@@ unity against other viruses .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
the first con@@ cre@@ te blocks were manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fix@@ ed measu@@ re@@ ment that fit together .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olymp@@ ics in 20@@ 12 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ roll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
to show you how slowly this mechan@@ ism disappe@@ ars and to illu@@ strate the tra@@ ces it leaves , which lead to something other than this gran@@ dio@@ se image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to conc@@ ern themselves with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic prototyp@@ es of communication , interaction , etc .
and that was the on@@ set of als .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
they were all called k@@ f@@ as at the time , the place in j@@ ü@@ lich was also called a k@@ f@@ a .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my belo@@ ved old teacher professor j@@ ür@@ gen u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and lon@@ g@@ standing professor at the conser@@ v@@ atory here in stu@@ tt@@ g@@ art .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a pool at a y@@ m@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
over here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission gui@@ dance system , the c@@ able &apos;s kilometer physics , to illu@@ strate the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior , so to speak , in the network .
in both cases , it &apos;s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to proper@@ ly use these little mus@@ cles that att@@ une the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds .
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , ha@@ cked it open , moun@@ ted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publi@@ sh the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cra@@ cks .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and kee@@ ps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
when we started our research on stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any major las@@ er prin@@ ter manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
leave that up to us .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cla@@ w .
you can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proje@@ ctions on them .
and what does intui@@ tive mean and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception work and how does cognitive process@@ ing work ?
so that made sense , that was a match .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
it was sum@@ mer@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swi@@ mming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
it &apos;s all com@@ post@@ able all of it .
last year at ted i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
she kind of set us up .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more deta@@ iled knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &apos;d learned theore@@ tically into practice .
over the last hundred years , the average human li@@ fes@@ pan has more than dou@@ bled , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ ju@@ sted for inf@@ lation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
this is a cheap pair of sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought at the ven@@ ice beach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from home de@@ po@@ t and radio sha@@ ck .
and none of it has any real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
i brought this project along as an example to illu@@ strate how these arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models are being add@@ ressed again .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
a terror@@ ist place , but it was was called wus@@ el@@ tr@@ oni@@ k and it made wind and solar power and that &apos;s where i started out in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
that is for people who can see a marine prote@@ cted area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ eline .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
just spread it as wide as possible .
everybody is now trying to re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise something in this pattern .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a cal@@ tech student , it was a person from england , from man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive assi@@ stant at a re@@ hab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
i or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him and asked my collea@@ gue to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is re@@ lie@@ ved with dies@@ el fuel , because you don &apos;t need a licen@@ se for it .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutri@@ ents from increasingly distance places .
we were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is really exciting .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that i have of how to do that is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use inter@@ active media and can come to the most satis@@ fying result possible .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every exi@@ sting species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated a fit@@ ness to its environment .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan turned the vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ ec@@ raft back towards the earth , in 199@@ 0 after it just passed saturn ?
in a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gress in fa@@ vor of this const@@ it@@ u@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin lesson with me .
and shor@@ tly there@@ after , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the con@@ gress to am@@ end their const@@ it@@ ution to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
we need this lie here , to keep the de@@ ception up@@ right , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i do not mean foot@@ ball .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well go@@ sh , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
every single harvard employe@@ e is now auto@@ matically en@@ roll@@ ed in a life@@ cycle fund .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core conc@@ ern of of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
and what happened is that we trans@@ fer@@ red the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predic@@ tors .
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
and what what are our values and what are what are our obje@@ c@@ tives , our fundamental principles ?
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
if it stopped twi@@ t@@ ching , you bur@@ y them .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compare them to .
and i ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and data .
he will have to process that as the present .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ po@@ late forward .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
in r@@ wand@@ a , even after the geno@@ cide , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstra@@ ct information .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
the pay@@ load goes onto the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mission ac@@ compli@@ shed .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agen@@ cy we talked to ad@@ vis@@ ed their cli@@ ents not to take part .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , then your consciousness is inje@@ cted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
but this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ kle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
and the room got very quie@@ t , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syste@@ matic killing of human beings .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defini@@ tions .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this hel@@ met .
and he had po@@ sted lots of nature videos in fact .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some present , as cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
they will even use tools like state tro@@ j@@ an to infe@@ ct your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pas@@ s@@ words .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dra@@ matic increase in fir@@ es .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worl@@ ds than the real world .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fan@@ cy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
and here there &apos;s this story about the wife of the bis@@ ho@@ p of wor@@ ce@@ ster .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from myster@@ y science theater was one of the first people to post a jo@@ ke about the video on twitter .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what pro@@ fil@@ ers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they make these imple@@ ment this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like that .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up and pl@@ us-@@ one strength , and pl@@ us-@@ one intelligence .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
and part of me also wonder@@ s , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scan@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ mr@@ i ?
in order to get target theor@@ ies , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely lo@@ cated in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infe@@ ctions had been repor@@ ted .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more -- his col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
evolution favor@@ s those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
they &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensor@@ s .
this is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
so let &apos;s project this analog@@ y going forward .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really un@@ ites everybody , is this fascin@@ ation with technology .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
number one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rec@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
is that something ?
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participa@@ te when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
how does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it means that when we can see that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
the dies@@ el will be the back@@ -up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
then it will turn into the past and , in that way , i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegan@@ t way , if i know this phenomenon .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it su@@ cks .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
and if , as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
imagine your your wife is sad , because you up@@ set her , and you turn up with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
i don &apos;t want to say five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in ad@@ v@@ ance .
and so in the fe@@ tal life the te@@ stes are pump@@ ing out te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and was@@ hed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , ju@@ stin bie@@ ber , got his start on youtube .
it was called the auto@@ matic bin@@ ding bri@@ ck .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
that also const@@ it@@ utes the entertain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
so if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
this is a re@@ construction of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done entirely compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type not@@ re d@@ ame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
but will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
and it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
so i made one .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
all this influ@@ ences me and influ@@ ences my experience of the com@@ position .
but usually i have an ac@@ cess@@ ory , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or i like cr@@ y@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
it might take a moment to load .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than down@@ town boston .
when i was a child , i had multiple colle@@ ctions of sti@@ cks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ells .
and he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with c@@ ameras ready usually .
at the moment we &apos;re growing cor@@ n and losing between el@@ even and thir@@ ty kil@@ ogra@@ ms thir@@ ty ton@@ nes per he@@ ct@@ are , if you were to calcu@@ late it per square me@@ tr@@ e .
and here you have the graphic again .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
they really go through it and create a frame@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will de@@ plo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cular recogni@@ tion technology , but i just recogni@@ zed something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
yes , that &apos;s possible .
and at that stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
i &apos;ve been illu@@ str@@ ating books since i was 16 .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
of course , the curi@@ osity , the science compon@@ ent of it -- it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity , it was imagination .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutri@@ ents .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embra@@ ce those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
everybody appl@@ au@@ ded poli@@ tely .
and none of these pl@@ ots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fif@@ ty of them in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years , none of these pl@@ ots was every s@@ ab@@ ot@@ a@@ ged .
however there is a political battle in our country .
really , you &apos;d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
and then you see that even something like de@@ meter , the stri@@ c@@ test organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c waste to be re@@ turned .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
and she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
now choo@@ sing not to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ i@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affec@@ ts us even in very con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al decisions .
and what we know from cros@@ s-@@ cultural studies is that fe@@ males , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wir@@ es .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
and certainly , we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
and from these , i can dri@@ ll into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
it &apos;s not about being sc@@ ar@@ ce , it &apos;s about acc@@ essi@@ bility .
why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ?
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless impli@@ cated .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine compon@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es .
that &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat .
so i got a ti@@ cket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e .
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russi@@ a , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agenda .
and that means there are too many of us .
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you &apos;re doing it un@@ consci@@ ously and , well , pretty intui@@ tively and also instin@@ c@@ tively in part .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , ster@@ i@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
and today we are still very , very depen@@ dent on stories .
and nei@@ ther your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
so in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that can be inclu@@ ded in that , like syn@@ thetic biology , etc .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own colle@@ ction across all these images .
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ...
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented all the various tas@@ ks that these ce@@ os enga@@ ged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- speak@@ ers , c@@ d player , ta@@ pe player , tun@@ er , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bom@@ bs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
you move around , you have fun .
we should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that makes that very production possible .
what were their life circum@@ stances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
i &apos;ll be reve@@ aling what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
so i followed my hun@@ ches .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
and during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m de@@ pic@@ ted the ge@@ ology and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region and that of course also made it possible to de@@ frag@@ ment these songs and re@@ ar@@ range them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
most people here have heard of them .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
and what you can do with it and approach@@ ing society very tar@@ ge@@ ted@@ ly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
this device has the ability to be in a quant@@ um super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
i wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an uns@@ ung sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters en@@ ding each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ ft@@ ables .
the united states has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves , ta@@ ps , opening and clo@@ sing .
those who were still around in school , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pped out .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
inv@@ enting his own narra@@ tive .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come a@@ par@@ thei@@ d without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of ja@@ m .
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the street art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ka@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
i &apos;m surprised .
that &apos;s not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that &apos;s really true .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y diet of science fi@@ ction .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a vi@@ o@@ lin string .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
that the human des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or .
on my show , on &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs to the ch@@ ie@@ f of car@@ di@@ a@@ c surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and i would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
and by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vi@@ bra@@ te and not vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amo@@ unts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtual worl@@ ds and online game environments . &quot;
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
i could also mention ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the usa nobody li@@ kes ter@@ mit@@ es , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
and the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preser@@ ve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sel@@ ec@@ ted out and be re@@ moved from the population .
you saw the big peak .
and one of the things we did at rad@@ b@@ oud university is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a ch@@ ie@@ f listening off@@ ic@@ er .
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .
the work of the interpre@@ ter starts off much like the work of a the@@ at@@ re director .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of moment@@ um .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an aff@@ air with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the exten@@ sion of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and te@@ ar , when they break , they can go into biological life cy@@ cles .
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
and the power u@@ tili@@ ty , which which the electric u@@ tili@@ ty on the island , said they think it &apos;s great .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neu@@ ral model or mental model , as software er@@ gon@@ om@@ ists say , because you &apos;d have a con@@ ception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s sti@@ cking out over a le@@ dge .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to attra@@ ct new resi@@ dents .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hu@@ d@@ son river .
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not har@@ m@@ ful .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year period .
so i want to extra@@ po@@ late on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
back then , when ar@@ jun@@ a , the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bo@@ w , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .
and if i then place a half o@@ val next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
and so that got me very excited .
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who then led to the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
because the leaders in the government there in hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ for@@ c@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
immediately after that vote , on febru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 24@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
so , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing for , but off i went -- up the sta@@ irs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; fire@@ figh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
if they could do it for them , sur@@ ely they could do it for me .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consum@@ ing memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a genu@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
that means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dro@@ pped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
while chimpanze@@ es are domin@@ ated by big , sc@@ ary guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fe@@ males .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ ig@@ ned themselves to what was happening .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
and when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human lau@@ ghter , dance and ritual .
i made it and i set to work tre@@ ating her .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
so to him , they were just blocks .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
by 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
and i think that there &apos;s theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
and when you have one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then it &apos;s like a self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient system .
perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &apos;ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , so computer ha@@ cker@@ spaces , c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five .
well we can &apos;t all be brand tom , but i do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark glam@@ or and cas@@ ual fly .
perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at her@@ self in the mirror every day and said , who is the fa@@ i@@ rest of them all ?
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
but today , it goes beyond that .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
now we talk about water wars .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then tra@@ pped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked out all the air , and then we cool@@ ed it down now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of metal is free to act however it wanted .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
so to make this blin@@ k faster or slo@@ wer , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i am brea@@ thing in its ancient atmosphere .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
we have tw@@ ent@@ y percent in germany .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it ben@@ ds toward justice .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ ots .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
so now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sav@@ ings .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
and yes , well , i &apos;d just like to motiv@@ ate you , in the sense that it &apos;s fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision .
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
woo@@ o !
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
because they have special skills of facili@@ tation .
and that being said , through hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; embra@@ ce transpar@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at em@@ c , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ bay .
but then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and ro@@ tation .
the first : cut .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one po@@ und of farm tun@@ a .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate auth@@ ority from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
thank you . so to understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
so this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tion@@ ing as a single organis@@ m .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
he would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from below and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the w@@ inning team .
who does the very best ?
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental nor we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
if you keep hit@@ ting the de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means i &apos;m losing you .
on the one hand there are the practical fun@@ ctions in terms of product language , so for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts .
but they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar aci@@ do@@ sis .
we should go through these efficiency meas@@ ures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : the less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already reti@@ red before i finally started studying .
so we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 300 .
it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil .
all cultures through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
let &apos;s take s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers for example , right ?
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educ@@ ated and healthy .
and how does it look in there ?
so this is all of the meta@@ -@@ data information .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the si@@ x-@@ in@@ ch layer on top .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
that means the first impres@@ sion comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we percei@@ ve things .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
and h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
the flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ dered , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
but that &apos;s my my prototyp@@ e , which looked pretty wild though , on a bran@@ ch and that , that thing on it , put the electr@@ on@@ ics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a com@@ passionate teacher , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
play &apos;s essential .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to mini@@ mi@@ ze sp@@ las@@ hing , you can actually lower the roof .
that means i &apos;ve cor@@ rup@@ ted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
we have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
which i would very much re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a lo@@ vely , communic@@ ative thing .
these are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
okay ? there we are slo@@ g@@ ging through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
these are the first shoes with which you make a jac@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit start at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an lights and the ru@@ b@@ ber so@@ le can go into biological cy@@ cles , okay ?
we do achieve more in game worl@@ ds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pas@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
there &apos;s ste@@ p-@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these ra@@ pid changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
so by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photogra@@ phic de@@ fe@@ cts like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
every year we lose about three ton@@ nes of phosp@@ hor@@ us , which should really be cir@@ cul@@ ated .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating spa@@ tial relationships .
we also brought one of these dies@@ el ag@@ gre@@ gates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the dies@@ el is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the conver@@ ters , with which we simu@@ late the network .
there are indi@@ c@@ ator fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where i have to look .
in fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
we all use it , and o@@ sit is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m that stands for ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
which is sing@@ ing .
and i go to the ja@@ il and i see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spee@@ ds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t regi@@ ster@@ ed .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effec@@ tivity .
you can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
the weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ u@@ ries .
dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
and he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant , called the surge@@ ons .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
there are . there always are .
so if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
but combin@@ ed , they can create something like this .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
and suddenly i have an interface that is consi@@ der@@ ably more intui@@ tive and natural .
i have had the distin@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
so the ancient artist was prote@@ cted from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
in two hours it &apos;s bio@@ de@@ gra@@ ded , wher@@ ever it is .
two years later i was an atten@@ ding in the emergen@@ cy department at a community hospital just north of tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
keep going . have fun .
and that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
for a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous red@@ und@@ ant op@@ tions , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choo@@ sing experience .
and just to say , what is information ?
and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed the time i wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
re@@ power america . find out more .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choo@@ sing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enzy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s auth@@ or , in fact .
i must hon@@ est@@ ly say , and you wit@@ n@@ essed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choo@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re choo@@ sing not to do other things .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . what is your brand ?
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin pas@@ sage work in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vac@@ cin@@ es .
now in the financial sav@@ ings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that david la@@ ib@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
so they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution .
you atta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intui@@ tive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
you prac@@ tically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no fre@@ a@@ king idea how i was going to c@@ ash .
i &apos;d like to rein@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to a particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ je@@ ction will kill you ?
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so , he &apos;s rational .
did you get a second or third opini@@ on , as people call it so ni@@ c@@ ely no@@ wa@@ days ?
let &apos;s make it kog@@ i . &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ e@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
in my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ ca@@ sting and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything i can , from one of the first artic@@ les i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
now i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
that is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refle@@ ction , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ ctive psych@@ ological constru@@ ct , right ?
a cru@@ cial tool in information bro@@ ker@@ age has always been stories .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
what about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
that &apos;s what kee@@ ps us going and kee@@ ps us developing .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ e@@ ful .
but for over two weeks , we progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the ven@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
we can also add a photo vol@@ ta@@ ic out@@ put of two hundred kil@@ o@@ watt + to the network .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
that made the whole thing consi@@ der@@ ably more user friend@@ ly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
i guess what kind of gen@@ re , style i am would be like dark glam@@ or .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; down on fri@@ day . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
that pos@@ es the question as to what is actually the most intui@@ tive performance sche@@ me that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
they even can bring with them some finan@@ cing .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classi@@ cal software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ i@@ stic thought in one 18 minute speech .
in a world where over two days of video get u@@ plo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
you know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opini@@ on , even come from the muse@@ ums .
others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergen@@ cy medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
secon@@ dly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
and it &apos;s colle@@ cted by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need car@@ di@@ ologi@@ c support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
this year we celebra@@ te the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illu@@ strated , i think , a truth about the human character .
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
you learn to find the t@@ ones on the instrument that go with the notes .
i say , ul@@ f , why do you need such a big car ?
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
when profess@@ ors become curious , they are often sho@@ ved into a research se@@ me@@ ster .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
and that &apos;s a multi-@@ million dollar corpo@@ ration .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
we do . as rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intelle@@ ct as we are .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
how do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
that &apos;s why com@@ pos@@ ers dep@@ end on us interpre@@ ters to rein@@ vent the pieces again and again .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
we &apos;ve done a really good job strug@@ gling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
but the process , and the heavy an@@ x@@ iety around it was rele@@ ased when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and rele@@ ased it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and i finally decided , oh go@@ sh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
and yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented con@@ temporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
when this device sequences an r@@ na or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the c@@ d@@ c and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mic from happening in the first place .
that &apos;s equivalent to the out@@ put of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is conver@@ ted particularly quickly .
so in other words , the future has kind of been s@@ hr@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents rei@@ gni@@ te the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to re@@ f@@ ute .
and the la@@ go@@ on was surro@@ unded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
there are also technical cy@@ cles .
and the great indi@@ c@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , e@@ ternal myster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human psy@@ che .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more acc@@ essi@@ ble with technology together .
the ground stor@@ es over six@@ ty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
we &apos;re che@@ aper than the dies@@ el system , if the price of dies@@ el ris@@ es by five percent a year .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cra@@ cks .
and in that bon@@ d , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
it is not only a nice w@@ all@@ paper made of noise .
among those pa@@ pers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot;
we now have techniques , because of these ra@@ pid metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
so i sig@@ ned the dis@@ charge pa@@ pers , and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce came , par@@ am@@ edi@@ cs came to take her home .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an acade@@ mic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a web@@ c@@ am , dis@@ man@@ t@@ led it , took off the l@@ ens , turned it around and then we have a microscop@@ e , which has a four hundred fold magni@@ fication appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
how can i make something as user friend@@ ly as possible ?
we wri@@ ters , we kind of do have that repu@@ tation , and not just wri@@ ters , but creative people across all gen@@ r@@ es , it seems , have this repu@@ tation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achie@@ ved , or are on their way to achie@@ ving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this remin@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish i had the night before .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psych@@ ed out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
and that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ mented state .
just one single one ?
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstra@@ ction .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also fri@@ days .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
so , the other grade is : are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
well the answer is , if i dre@@ w it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
super@@ ior technology .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , one y@@ ard of ta@@ pe , one y@@ ard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was ex@@ ecu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately je@@ wish ?
we sett@@ led in foot@@ sc@@ ray , a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
at most , they &apos;d stick a fe@@ a@@ ther on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twi@@ t@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them yet .
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
if they become more intui@@ tive and then i have to rough@@ -@@ hand@@ le my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , when is something really intui@@ tive ?
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble mer@@ ce@@ des ben@@ z .
the mel@@ o@@ dy is created through what &apos;s being sung and rhyth@@ m is created through dance .
and they did this using so-@@ called lead maps .
and that &apos;s not within the range of ama@@ te@@ urs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
so , please for@@ give me .
not , if i am environ@@ ment@@ ally aware here on the local level and the neighb@@ our is less environ@@ ment@@ ally aware , the whole thing will no longer work .
so i looked into when things are natural and intui@@ tive .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
this is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure .
so you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively mana@@ ge@@ able , and what does that mean fundament@@ ally .
my third little story is that i was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the introdu@@ ction of tra@@ w@@ ling in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
in my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
going back to my actual top@@ ic natural user interface and the top@@ ic that &apos;s behind that is us@@ ability of course .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
and if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it .
we need to find ways to embra@@ ce these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
adap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock clim@@ b and even hand@@ cycle .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system su@@ cks .
and no important en@@ dea@@ vor that requi@@ red innovation was done without risk .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave la@@ tin america to go to the united states .
and it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
people always ask me , what are you resear@@ ching in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of all the time ?
but what i wo@@ und up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
in fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
that &apos;s why all western emp@@ ires just kept on exp@@ and@@ ing until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they im@@ plo@@ ded .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the still@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
through a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user testing , i tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essen@@ ti@@ als .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
you zo@@ om in . you really go in .
but now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural an@@ x@@ iety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
at the time i was as@@ sig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology ro@@ tation .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transpor@@ ts you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ mil@@ l electro@@ chemical battery .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his ch@@ ie@@ f of staf@@ f .
so we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
pattern recogni@@ tion should also work .
and their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would re@@ co@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
so it &apos;s just like from the hollywood movies where during the hei@@ st , the obser@@ vation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded video .
we talk about it in ir@@ onic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the hori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ um@@ p@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
it &apos;s certainly now it &apos;s that &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly within a range that makes it much more acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
i tell them about terror@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to world war ii .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
in the descri@@ ption of my pres@@ entation , it is written that i , as an interpre@@ ter , see myself as a transl@@ ator , in the english sense of the word .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate bi@@ og@@ as , on one he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand in@@ habit@@ ants in the fa@@ vel@@ as , a farmer can ear@@ n about one thousand five hundred dollars and main@@ tain the p@@ lot with it , raise chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and du@@ cks and grow vege@@ tables and farm fish .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year yo@@ unger .
i mean , that was epi@@ c .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
children , el@@ der@@ ly people , all sorts of people go there to simply exam@@ ine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory proto@@ col@@ s .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
and that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
what what happened there ?
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
by not partici@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
because the soil will the mo@@ ss dies and the the wind and water was@@ h away the soil .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i ho@@ p on , it sen@@ ds my data through google health as well .
and it &apos;s just standard sele@@ ction : we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , v@@ acc@@ ine production , etc .
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been jo@@ ining my side in the last couple of years .
the bro@@ ch@@ ures still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
the woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it didn &apos;t look anything like her .
we went to san pau@@ l@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door adverti@@ sing .
so the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
especially in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fra@@ c@@ tured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mas@@ ses ?
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is bat@@ tles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a best@@ s@@ eller on the men@@ u .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but so many over the years were helped .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
so with that , i thank you .
can you play it in blue now ?
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they com@@ mit , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive ma@@ inten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challen@@ ger brand .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet him at a very young age , when i was thir@@ te@@ en , and so i always atten@@ ded his cour@@ ses while i was at school .
because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ch leader , talked about this .
then , in my opini@@ on , a really good code was created .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
the sm@@ ells from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worl@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just intensi@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produ@@ cers , but experts in relationships .
