it always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and very importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
but combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
all those things ste@@ mm@@ ed and started from one place , and for me they ste@@ mm@@ ed and started with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
a couple months went by , and i had just for@@ gotten all about it .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
last month , i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing with qu@@ al@@ com@@ m foundation something called the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
obviously , this is resul@@ ting in some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic back in@@ ju@@ ries .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now .
so how does it happen ?
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient ro@@ me .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical .
a friend of mine did that -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
and i think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
that means that everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing .
and this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing to me .
now how many times have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader ele@@ cted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refle@@ ct our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
this app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is sing@@ apo@@ re .
so we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
so we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in se@@ attle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ a@@ tics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ a@@ tics at all .
we &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
are you establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , em@@ pa@@ thetic like the op@@ ra@@ h ?
want to feed the world ?
they stopped us from being inspired .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
and this is the p@@ lot behind stu@@ x@@ net .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ th-@@ e@@ ast@@ -@@ asia .
and whenever you are in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed which can save lives .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy share of fif@@ te@@ en percent at the moment .
i have a friend who dri@@ ves a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
well i went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty to prove that there are predic@@ tors .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- forever .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way each time .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fe@@ eding chicken to fish ? &quot;
the che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
so it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
and you can actually say things here that have im@@ pac@@ ts around the world .
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experiment@@ al trial going on with v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
if you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
we would never do that in our own countries .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
i &apos;m aware of the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ ft@@ ables up .
he was actually colle@@ cting fish .
a research se@@ me@@ ster on the top@@ ic natural user interface design .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
this is an old study .
so meet al .
well , we pres@@ ented this to ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ loch .
and so when i started travel@@ ing and going to these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se@@ -up of the little piece of metal .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
so let me now introdu@@ ce to you h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal load car@@ rier .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
turn the camera off .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
one such person who opened do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , del@@ aware .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
so it says , &quot; place your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
and 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom .
groups like anony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attac@@ ks .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
that means you can see how to win back nutri@@ ents on the internet .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
so the question is , how should we deal with na@@ pp@@ ies ?
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came up with this .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and what is that thing ?
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
that number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapi@@ dly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ une moment when i can take care of you .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the notion of happiness .
could you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
so what i want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus i show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choo@@ sing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
the music instrument is an exten@@ sion of our own body .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
so we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an en@@ tic@@ ing , intri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .
and it worked for a while , until i met mr@@ s. dru@@ cker .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
now we do the same with air@@ planes .
i had written these crazy things .
you can see the water coming .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , acci@@ dents .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categ@@ ories would make somebody like me really happy .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
it came out of the university of washington in se@@ attle .
we were a group of tw@@ ent@@ y people .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gles of con@@ go .
it &apos;s all bo@@ und by oxygen and silic@@ ates .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
and that &apos;s nothing .
and i see the same process with combin@@ ing photographs .
what are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
and he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
so , i say : let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
in the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist eastern germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
while any@@ time i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
it &apos;s the so-@@ called o@@ sit model .
and they actually ill@@ umin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
and if we show that to people , then we can also pro@@ mote some behavi@@ oral change .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
that &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then aug@@ ments my strength and en@@ dur@@ ance .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk . &quot;
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
sexual re@@ production en@@ ters the picture .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
so we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have .
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
very simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
but there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ plo@@ aded to youtube every minute .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display , like this -- a regular con@@ figu@@ ration in two dimensions .
and those days are gone .
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
people were going crazy .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
amazing ! the machin@@ ery is kind of l@@ oud .
i really do believe that , and , no , it a@@ in &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
we are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
and then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
we &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
so sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once pain@@ ted a portra@@ it of a woman .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swe@@ dis@@ h .
now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
this is a portra@@ it by a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- balance .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be va@@ stly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon just last apri@@ l .
he was over six@@ ty at the time .
we were given very accu@@ rate data .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
everyone take their vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
we &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contro@@ ls in our car .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this da@@ y-@@ in and da@@ y-@@ out .
very different notion .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
so all of the green areas , these are your tar@@ ge@@ t-@@ rich environments .
my opini@@ on is that the mo@@ s@@ sad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
spec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven we know that he listen@@ ed more once he &apos;d already gone dea@@ f .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electr@@ on@@ ics .
my mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fe@@ males in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
i no longer try to be right ; i choose to be happy .
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choo@@ sing to have more males than fe@@ males .
that &apos;s your only chance .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
and my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , ted .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
why do this ?
we still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
if we turn off the dies@@ el , then you will no longer have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes a certain amount of i@@ d@@ len@@ ess in the network .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classi@@ cal music .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
and this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
you can show that you were there .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry .
but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
she saved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the teachers &apos; lo@@ un@@ ge .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
so that worked . so boo@@ ya for scot@@ t .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a y chromo@@ some .
because artists have a di@@ stor@@ ted relationship to the lie .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park .
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ; i don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , i don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
no f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
do we really want to go there ?
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a c@@ age .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
now we can do it in a more pre@@ cise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vi@@ tam@@ in a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
and i think there &apos;s almost a parado@@ x with those .
here you have it again .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
and now i &apos;ll atta@@ ch the filter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
we &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which br@@ ands .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting cle@@ aner everyday .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photographs .
so , the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents with you .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government offi@@ cial giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
i started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in nat@@ anz and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de , and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
so in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion , i have to first ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;m a huge fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m itali@@ an origin@@ ally , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in for@@ mul@@ a 1 ra@@ cing over the past couple of decades .
this en@@ com@@ pas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is , i &apos;m out@@ fit@@ -@@ obs@@ essed .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
we have to engage with the machin@@ ery of government .
well , at se@@ vent@@ e@@ en you still have dreams , but no significant memor@@ ies .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
it &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
so i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
this guy &apos;s name is temp@@ t .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ onen .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musi@@ cians that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and respe@@ cted him .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self kee@@ ps for us .
first you see from back to front .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
but in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always ye@@ ar@@ ned for more creativity .
and the more we &apos;re able to be choo@@ sy about choo@@ sing the better we will be able to practice the art of choo@@ sing .
i don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
there was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and dar@@ ing .
it was the threat of ter@@ ror that sha@@ ped their lives .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explan@@ ation of what we &apos;re about to see .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have de@@ vot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
this is not like human insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chemi@@ cally indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its as a material .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your being came from you .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
i first went to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
will it be under $ 20 ?
just do your job .
so if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have pl@@ ent@@ y for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
and she asked him , so what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
and finally , satur@@ day : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
if you think the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
and i got a big sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
and that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
you know , is it rational ?
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ rene@@ wing .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
we have been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
of course not everything should be com@@ post@@ able .
you make compar@@ is@@ ons .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fl@@ es@@ h .
stu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wir@@ es can take that current .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
we are ready with our industry partner to introdu@@ ce this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
we sele@@ ct a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this glo@@ be .
and then we have to de@@ cre@@ ase our mu@@ st-@@ run capac@@ i@@ ties in the network .
to these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
but even if you imple@@ ment these indi@@ cations , it still just rema@@ ins something technical .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when i was yo@@ unger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and that generally looks like this .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ g@@ ging you ? &quot;
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spi@@ ritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
and i went through this roll@@ er co@@ aster , because after they stabili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and i hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s projects by michael bur@@ k , an@@ n-@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ enz , j@@ or@@ is kl@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z mü@@ ll@@ er .
these people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars inje@@ cted into the global economy .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been de@@ plo@@ yed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s colle@@ cted anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
and we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wor@@ e the entire week .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of ja@@ m .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
that means there are not too many of us , we &apos;re just too stupid , you see ?
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
we need to go far , quickly .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
um , my brand ?
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , &quot; wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
none of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
you can see this at the bottom .
a school uni@@ form down to the an@@ kl@@ es , because it had to last for six years .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was to be ob@@ tain@@ ed right now .
we &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
he re@@ treated into sil@@ ence .
i know they were ra@@ ci@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
i think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
but where would be the ne@@ ar@@ est a@@ ed to help this patient ?
that means our entire intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be more stupid than trees , you see ?
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ sto@@ m make your car .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it .
something sho@@ ots through my head .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing life .
and we absor@@ b all of it .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototyp@@ e .
i can help you .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
when countries get together in places like cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the co2 .
so all of our intelligence amo@@ unts to us wan@@ ting to be du@@ mber than trees .
i wanted to re@@ store health from disease .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
this was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ tles us in terms of those categ@@ ori@@ zations .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
given who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
essentially con@@ cre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conver@@ sa@@ tions with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
and to my hor@@ ror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
the great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ t@@ led &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t necessarily fa@@ vor the biggest or the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
and so there are too many of us .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amo@@ unts of visual data .
and this kind of trans@@ fer@@ al , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .
but because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ gra@@ der , not much arti@@ stic talent ...
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
le@@ go has essentially taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
we all know that inter@@ active media is , by definition , non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the ne@@ gation of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and which of course tells us that we consider lin@@ ear@@ ity normal today .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contain@@ ed within a single mar@@ ble .
and one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hotel room door .
that must be our difference in age .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
and they found that the average ce@@ o enga@@ ged in about 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
and the biggest question i get asked no@@ wa@@ days is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
there &apos;s a guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpo@@ ra@@ tions and governments could only do in the past .
he invited over to dinner the king of si@@ am .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
but if i could give it and still see them sa@@ f@@ ely through , i would .
eating an entire bow@@ l of cool whi@@ p .
and i simply assu@@ me that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical reser@@ vo@@ irs in the whole world for the next thir@@ ty years .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an x chromo@@ some , meeting the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so any@@ how .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that must be respe@@ cted by law .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ c to these arch@@ a@@ ic models is the fact that we have a princi@@ p@@ ally natural relationship with virtu@@ ality .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categ@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and we@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
the second major group of attac@@ kers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one f@@ at@@ al fla@@ w , and that fla@@ w was this .
the ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s un@@ fair .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
to this day , they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
there had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
and these are not characteri@@ stics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertain@@ ment of the future .
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , those who will never get to ted .
but the cool@@ est i ever worked on was around this guy .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
and that sa@@ dness really fra@@ med in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
the brown bit is the conven@@ tional system so to speak , the green bit is our system .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
a particularly nice story , in my opini@@ on .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
so two cy@@ cles are created .
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
as the one hat , i do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those docum@@ ent@@ aries .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a conf@@ using way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &apos;t tell which one is s@@ alt and which one is pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can basically design them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
okay , we can do that .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and as far as isol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do col@@ oni@@ ze dist@@ ant planets , there will be the isol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good deal of lo@@ gic to string together these complex ideas .
we started this over 15 years ago .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
he &apos;s only dec@@ ei@@ ving you and not himself .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
the next slide i show you will be a ra@@ pid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
we can go to watch our kid play soc@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , on our la@@ ps .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different an@@ gles .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
he had had the experience .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
so i was trying to per@@ su@@ ade the hon@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
like here , we have mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of k@@ ie@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the d@@ m@@ v and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
because you can train that .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concern@@ s about that .
that makes the baby carb@@ on-@@ positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
not by the lat@@ est com@@ bine and tra@@ ctor invention , but by ferti@@ le land ; not by pump@@ s , but by fresh water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by fore@@ sts ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you are you really serious ?
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life .
you see the image of the place called cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since ro@@ man times , people go to celebra@@ te , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
and really you do the same thing .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ mir kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the u.@@ s .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has ra@@ ged for decades and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
so you don &apos;t need to ab@@ sta@@ in from listening to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
what is the media today ?
they live lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
you can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her under@@ wear -- that means i found a few things .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on e@@ bay .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
it &apos;s exciting every time , because i read something new in it every time .
i want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day , at the ex@@ act same moment , each conc@@ ei@@ ving a baby -- okay ?
and i put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
now i put a b@@ ass line in .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds already in the ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
ant@@ ony@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical quant@@ um super@@ position .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
and then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
if those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
i was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
it &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
but thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ?
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
it res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graph@@ y of the glo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ ler@@ y .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
how would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with bes@@ i@@ des your existence as a designer .
another very exciting phenomenon .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
re@@ bec@@ ca black &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
so as i do this , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these ad@@ vent@@ ures wearing nothing new .
we think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
because while you are bus@@ y telling yourself that you can &apos;t prove that there are no predic@@ tors , your counter@@ part will be very happy .
so , simple : you come to goog@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra pun@@ ch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
because with marine prote@@ cted areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
and most pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to in@@ her@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wi@@ sely ?
they are fru@@ strated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the exten@@ sions of my fing@@ ers .
but in my humanity , i also allow my e@@ go to get in .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
i &apos;m happy to be here .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
it is almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
one con@@ sequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
you see , al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
i just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alterna@@ te reality .
a kind of ast@@ on@@ ishing er@@ ror rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
the one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
so sex can come in lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
b@@ g : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
imagine you could have small heli@@ cop@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
the human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
you see , even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
for us and them , play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ ster@@ ing toler@@ ance .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or bee@@ f c@@ attle .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical do@@ ma@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
henry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embra@@ ce patients in the team .
but don &apos;t think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any inten@@ tion of building a wall .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like london &apos;s new moun@@ tain@@ top .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up survey .
you collect information about the piece in secon@@ dar@@ y liter@@ ature .
but not only are we going to have the brand x ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
sa@@ dly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ united with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
an au@@ ti@@ stic pu@@ pi@@ l .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
i want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes wheel@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
i want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
it doesn &apos;t have this sou@@ l .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
good after@@ noon , everybody .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
the other hat that i &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist , as a patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient ad@@ vo@@ cate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
so , this is world without oil .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
a long time , yes .
but then you really want to go deep .
now , chimpanze@@ es are well-@@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
the small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ ca@@ de , and sp@@ inning up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ wing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and mani@@ pul@@ ating val@@ ves .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
and if they &apos;re on a smar@@ t@@ phone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
what should our report card look like ?
and we think we &apos;re prote@@ cting the environment when we do a little less damage .
i don &apos;t know who re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ es what .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
so the first rule is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
from the modern to the computer society .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ tors , which would be prop@@ he@@ t .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citi@@ zen .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
well i ad@@ or@@ ed my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
i mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her ?
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
think about it , that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile com@@ m than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end .
and i &apos;ve been repres@@ enting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now .
i think it &apos;s better if we encoura@@ ge our great creative minds to live .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
well bill , i sus@@ pe@@ ct i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
so if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
tan le , anony@@ mous foot@@ sc@@ ray resi@@ dent , was now tan le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , invited to speak in ven@@ u@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imag@@ ined .
a few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to ris@@ d and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar there , his name is wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes people say , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no free will .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizar@@ re collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ ternal thing that was not quite tom .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so please listen when music is played .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic at@@ titude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
and that &apos;s on a higher gra@@ il of user friend@@ lin@@ ess than the trans@@ fer@@ al of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the one of the des@@ k@@ top .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean coal facili@@ ty .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fett@@ i can@@ on ball .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community .
then my question is , how profession@@ ally compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ?
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
it turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
so after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
so those are just a few of the cli@@ ps i colle@@ cted over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where i &apos;ve inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ards .
r@@ al@@ ph , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ s@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
at mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading vir@@ ally .
we say sustain@@ ability in germany .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved you .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
but it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that kee@@ ps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
this picture &apos;s from there .
and curi@@ osity can &apos;t be learned .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a lie .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifest@@ yle .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
and the object of this is quite simple .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appe@@ ared in this issue , the spor@@ ts .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w-@@ away ment@@ ality .
if we over@@ sho@@ ot , we can po@@ ur a little bit back .
the game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisti@@ cated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dri@@ ll into a decade .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wil@@ ds of city hall .
we &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
and i think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation that we have to change .
and i cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing d@@ res@@ s-@@ up , or that i re@@ mind them of their se@@ ven@@ -year-old .
what needed to be done ?
a child in london puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
we hope that this means no more po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
they live in an environment of che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very ra@@ pid dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intui@@ tive it is .
yeah , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward one .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
last month scientists repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ visi@@ ons .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
i came to realize , as a physi@@ cian , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , just different .
she &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
i want to show you something here for the first time .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurz@@ weil and i started a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
yeah .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and even if they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a soc@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
one day she came back from her school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about one of her pu@@ p@@ ils .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attac@@ ks are not in the middle east .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too over speed , you must open re@@ lief val@@ ves within a milli@@ second .
i like really nice clo@@ th@@ es .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and sho@@ ot a video .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ?
it ta@@ sted swe@@ et and clean , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
a project i set up myself with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , was one in which we wanted to create a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical t@@ wee@@ z@@ ers .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion machin@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding proteins than the best computers .
it &apos;s a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
so here , we have a young female and a male enga@@ ged in a ch@@ ase game .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that that as@@ sur@@ ance of en@@ for@@ c@@ ement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and di@@ str@@ ust .
now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing activity happening on the network .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
you have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
now we see the opposite effect .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ und@@ ance that no one could have ever predi@@ cted .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still pri@@ mar@@ ily at .
in order to ada@@ pt success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
and it must go back .
he kept poin@@ ting here .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasi@@ on i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
mean@@ while , i was getting ready to give a talk at ted@@ global .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
the only thing they had was their mind .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
and after we experim@@ ented with different fla@@ vor@@ s of che@@ ese , i realized , well , this is a direc@@ ted attack .
the fellow pas@@ sen@@ gers for in@@ anima@@ te objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ ining on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any i talked about pres@@ ented itself .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the boo@@ ster rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new con@@ ception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ pa stage are you in now ?
the so-@@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which origin@@ ally comes from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , and it &apos;s a network based in europe with a co@@ operation in india , but it has members and active people all over the world by now .
evolution is all about pas@@ sing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
well let me work up some blood for you .
he &apos;ll auto@@ matically go to the right thought .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
just as an asi@@ de , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global theme .
interpre@@ ters are trans@@ lat@@ ors of the written notes in res@@ o@@ unding music .
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand li@@ ters of clean drin@@ king water a day out of any source -- sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two cents a li@@ ter .
and then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that kee@@ ps sc@@ ore , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
you see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with car st@@ ops , they play with these little weird particles .
it goes against justice .
but the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very li@@ vely .
now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ noon , i had a ch@@ at with g@@ ary .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fi@@ ction movie .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous ted din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
a couple of years ago , the las@@ ker prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast , and by mani@@ pul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to rever@@ t to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
the third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ ingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
there was the le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ fen nuclear research plant .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way .
so i just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
so neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
you want to navi@@ gate around the museum ?
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
car colors , ex@@ teri@@ or car colors -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
you can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
they were still kind of happy .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape re@@ al-@@ world suffering .
our organis@@ m has come up with an exc@@ ell@@ ent method to make un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings like en@@ vy simply disappe@@ ar .
usually , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mira@@ cle by a certain date .
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving environment .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it &apos;s when we war@@ med it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fair@@ er than you .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s comple@@ ting the whole circle -- is that in apri@@ l of this year , at the ge@@ ffen mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the ni@@ c@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
i think we would all understand the sen@@ ti@@ ment that woo@@ dy allen expres@@ sed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
we think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
but what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is tac@@ kl@@ ing the problem of government -- not as the problem of an o@@ ssi@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
they have a distin@@ ct way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
i met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
and so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound wei@@ r@@ dness of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of as@@ hes and was placed in my hands .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as in ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular seas@@ on .
and that was the message that i absor@@ bed when i was in med school .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
i mean , this is just my logi@@ cal side talking .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surge@@ on or physi@@ cian or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t result .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
any time i &apos;m ready to go , any time i open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see ban de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
and so -- it says , &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this frame@@ work .
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation among many that you can use .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
but where are we of use ?
to form a phr@@ ase with one &apos;s own breath .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machin@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
and i memor@@ i@@ zed everything .
if you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ -@@ chemistry .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
you &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t po@@ ll@@ ute . &quot;
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
if you think the display on the left is s@@ wing and the display on the right is ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ es . &quot;
this is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
tu@@ es@@ day : fit@@ ting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
but we need this everywhere .
or photos like these -- both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of re@@ alism .
i was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ ands that i made on myself .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ada@@ pt .
so beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
you see the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um in the middle , the river ti@@ ber .
and that &apos;s why it is so stron@@ g@@ ly ro@@ ot@@ ed in us , this ability to deal with virtu@@ ality .
and of course the stories that i cho@@ se to tell were science fi@@ ction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and by the way , we im@@ migra@@ te and circu@@ late and inter@@ mix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
and do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for instance .
what will these people want ?
of course it totally conf@@ uses us , because on the one hand we &apos;re seeing this new media , soci@@ l social media , facebook etc .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be enga@@ ged in .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
and half of the wa@@ ste@@ water problem worldwide is caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
thank you guys very much . that was a@@ wes@@ ome .
i don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
the process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , i guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something rein@@ forces its rate of change .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
i was ex@@ posed to him .
i had the great privi@@ lege , when i was a young law@@ yer , of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
so you could feel good about selling it .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an at@@ m card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environ@@ ment@@ ally aware .
we know perfectly where all the at@@ ms are about the city of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht .
it won &apos;t .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
early after@@ noon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
these results have been ob@@ tain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard labor .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
why not have the quick twi@@ tch muscle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us-@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us-@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us-@@ 20 crazy idea .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
so scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
isn &apos;t that a@@ wes@@ ome ?
that means that if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reser@@ vo@@ ir .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way of eng@@ aging with the building became something different .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ological constru@@ ct to protect you from the results of your work .
we &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
and so over here you need to ti@@ lt your i@@ pad , take the fire@@ flies out .
and it will sound completely different from before .
when we first sequen@@ ced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accu@@ ra@@ cy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
this is not a finished story .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
just a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering awar@@ ded its dra@@ per prize to fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who indepen@@ d@@ ently developed techniques to encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- what fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old calls &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot;
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more pre@@ cise , more accu@@ rate and quick@@ er .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
we want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
in those countries where people have money .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
... doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er co@@ aster are you on ?
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 ted talk .
right ?
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , because i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
and i would love for ce@@ g to help make it happen .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning dete@@ ctor , our dan@@ ger dete@@ ctor .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te ?
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
i need you to go up@@ sta@@ irs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
so here it is .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
na@@ than@@ iel dro@@ pped out of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angeles .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simul@@ tane@@ ously the media produ@@ cer and medium .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vac@@ cin@@ es for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
we ki@@ cked his bed so that he could see out .
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said very ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
as the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ asing miner@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that n@@ our@@ ish@@ es many forms of life .
an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you might know talks about this time .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
they built this intri@@ cate series of can@@ als , and they pus@@ hed water off the land and out into the river .
my ja@@ w dro@@ pped , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
he liked it very much .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
i talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
i no longer want to post@@ po@@ ne anything in life .
and police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and assi@@ stant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and c@@ ler@@ k workers .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bor@@ ed .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determin@@ ed by the larger ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack that immediately attra@@ cts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our addi@@ ction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surge@@ on i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name for himself .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radio .
ask questions , demand pro@@ of , demand evidence .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next satur@@ day .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
when i found the cap@@ tain , he was having a very eng@@ aging conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner , who was sur@@ ely having one of the worst days of her life .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
evolution has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
priv@@ acy is not up for discussion .
for example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
it mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
what i want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing , where the entire film is fund@@ ed by product plac@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
fine .
... meaning not so optimi@@ stic .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . thanks .
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants wei@@ gh four times as much a people .
and every now and then m@@ s. car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ s. par@@ ks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
and we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in the last tw@@ ent@@ y years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand ton@@ nes of ur@@ ani@@ um was put onto our fields in germany .
and these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same hei@@ ght and in the same type of light .
you study works that have been com@@ posed before or after .
we have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ cin@@ es , fuel for the six and a half billion .
because it doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack it should go to first .
that &apos;s high-@@ tech agriculture of course , but the pl@@ ots take care of themselves .
are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive or wise like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
and i &apos;m ba@@ w@@ ling , i &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
so i told my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our cli@@ ent base . &quot;
so that &apos;s a tough one .
we don &apos;t get that kind of const@@ ant feedback in real life .
and what if you want to see how van go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
people who have never sung con@@ sequ@@ ently never directly felt with their own body what it &apos;s like to create a t@@ one .
play is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
and my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so i could wake her .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
and to see how we process information , how do we absor@@ b information ?
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ mit@@ s .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
and so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for c@@ amer@@ on to do &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
if you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
a all the beautiful things in life are in@@ efficient .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ clu@@ sive or anything .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity .
imagination is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logi@@ cal side either .
i asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
the big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures .
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sculp@@ ted the mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shou@@ ted , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
and i thought i could bl@@ end in .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automo@@ bile factory .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you cho@@ se .
so , so far , colle@@ c@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ oth .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain bear .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
i felt like anyone could do that .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
unlike the one-@@ way entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , this community participa@@ tion is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or by doing something new with it .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sp@@ ering .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
how to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost profi@@ le .
the data says it all the time .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanze@@ es , your living clo@@ s@@ est relative .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the earth .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absor@@ b and rele@@ ase phosp@@ hor@@ us .
she wasn &apos;t going to vac@@ cin@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
so , you can do it .
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
there were gra@@ y wh@@ ales in ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
instead of pus@@ hing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
so we must get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and my love of science fi@@ ction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
that means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world .
it has sensor@@ s .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
you know , geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
i have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
like that , you know .
can we do this differently ?
i &apos;m surprised that people often forget something very element@@ ary .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limit@@ s of possibility .
b@@ g : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
so we don &apos;t need to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be cli@@ ma@@ te@@ -@@ positive .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus v@@ acc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
yes , here is the data .
as we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
and the second aspe@@ ct is that since we because of these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual man@@ ner , although we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assem@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
there &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then tag it .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
because i was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
it &apos;s not just code for america fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing ci@@ vi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
well , so it says pre@@ st@@ o at the top , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
so it &apos;s got c@@ ute little game dynam@@ ics on it .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange a@@ qua@@ tic plants .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
whether it &apos;s a &quot; fl@@ oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
very quickly con@@ cre@@ te blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ dow .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
you see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
sc@@ ore them again .
working with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are invi@@ ting them to learn social innovation skills .
or take li@@ p@@ stick .
cloud computing , what my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call infin@@ ite computing ; sensor@@ s and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3d prin@@ ting , which is the ability to democra@@ ti@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; syn@@ thetic biology ; fu@@ els , vac@@ cin@@ es and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ o@@ materials ; and a@@ .@@ i .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gui@@ ded and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
that was all .
this is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
now mind you , i want to main@@ tain some di@@ visi@@ ons , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototyp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ve prototyp@@ es , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototyp@@ es along the way .
the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned posi@@ tively or nega@@ tively on twitter .
how enga@@ ged you are .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time ever in human history .
for better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
and if you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the ima@@ gery ?
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
thank you guys .
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an , exactly .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kil@@ o@@ watt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
and if you want the ulti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college under@@ graduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pas@@ sing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing dou@@ b@@ ts .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion , be perfect .
of course you can only do that if you &apos;re being managed here somehow .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the kog@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
so if we look at the development of our society , sum@@ mar@@ is@@ ed brie@@ fly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es can take over the entire network .
we have thir@@ ty gi@@ ga@@ watt of phot@@ o-@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic power in germany .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another s@@ hal@@ low la@@ ke last winter .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
today , more than ever , a little hon@@ est@@ y is going to go a long way .
not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
and if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
who are these cou@@ s@@ ins ?
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us , and then in dec@@ ember , time magazine hon@@ or@@ ed us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really cool .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and i can use them to po@@ ur color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ bu@@ tt in a moment .
and on this cur@@ ve , ri@@ ding on mo@@ ore &apos;s law , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link cau@@ sation and cor@@ relation .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and it really changed the dynamic .
b@@ g : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
and so i jum@@ ped in , i jum@@ ped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
and so i did .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
but not only that -- it will integra@@ te and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
if we had tw@@ ent@@ y percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
but with only one company , one agen@@ cy willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ baum for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
evolution does not necessarily fa@@ vor the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ lived .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
that was the first re@@ al-@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
if you have 10 teams that typically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
let me now introdu@@ ce you to ele@@ gs that is wor@@ n by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel that 19 years ago was spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ var@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
so you can &apos;t solve that .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of pro@@ to-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ed organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
and this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern spa@@ in , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it also needs -- it needs dig@@ ni@@ ty , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
i learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
i fo@@ unded an institute with this in mind .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
they probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
but every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ scen@@ dent .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
protect the environment , produce less ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h .
it &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent is made of al@@ umin@@ um .
imagine a big explosion as you clim@@ b through 3,000 ft .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just quant@@ um objects just cra@@ mm@@ ed into a tiny space .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gala@@ pa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
and it de@@ als with proble@@ m-@@ solving in a play@@ ful , creative , original way .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gical device within the device .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe did lots of development projects .
and so , my fellow pri@@ mates , let us embra@@ ce this gift from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ lo@@ w@@ ship and wonder .
fe@@ males , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands .
that &apos;s our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have trans@@ mission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
your plant can b@@ low up .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
the other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
how do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ hn@@ ess , more fres@@ hn@@ ess , three times fres@@ her .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magni@@ tude in performance scale .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that apply to the entire sequence .
and i was blo@@ wn away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
it was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everyone .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
but i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the la@@ p of our parents .
feed grain to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re fe@@ eding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
but the spa@@ tial arr@@ ange@@ ment of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
so by sha@@ king the si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of !
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
one a baby needs about si@@ x-@@ thousand na@@ pp@@ ies .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheel@@ chair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
so we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physi@@ cally , the european one .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
in high school , a class@@ mate once said that brian gold@@ man would study for a blood test .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
the first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to ad@@ mit complexity .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that choo@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be cho@@ sen .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
and that &apos;s become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , well , infrastructure cent@@ r@@ es , which are being repres@@ ented all over the world .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew i was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered myself a fe@@ min@@ ist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
and if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite reali@@ stic .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing dna is very difficult .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communic@@ ations device -- i give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically .
today we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ titude in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es at the same time .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
i had a great education -- i &apos;m not com@@ pla@@ ining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these muse@@ ums and these art@@ works .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thou@@ sand@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large foot@@ print , which will turn into we@@ t@@ land .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
then my answer is , but i &apos;m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that &apos;s obvious .
the an@@ not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
... yet .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally .
there was also recently a study done with ce@@ os in which they followed ce@@ os around for a whole week .
a tv or a was@@ hing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t exp@@ end them .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
and the pre@@ mis@@ e was a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
i don &apos;t need to get emotion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
and you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
the can@@ adi@@ an government in apri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
now there &apos;s play@@ ful br@@ ands and min@@ d@@ ful br@@ ands , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
that means something built in a city .
so in this project , we actually developed some small ta@@ gs to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
the data came back .
here &apos;s v@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the w@@ inning team and the prime minister at the time .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious br@@ ands .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from reading these books .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
she was back and near death .
this is ste@@ phen watt .
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
so the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
it started with a question by the ma@@ yo@@ r of the city , who came to us saying that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
and the set was based as an ex@@ act repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
now we can come up with the second theor@@ em and say : if wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , then he has no free will .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as it would become .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
i &apos;m a histor@@ ian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have de@@ alt with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ alt with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ ids , concep@@ ts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means the water will re@@ main in the field for longer .
so tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participa@@ tion rate .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
well , when there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that you re@@ je@@ ct , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
now you see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
these poor ap@@ sar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , i have to ad@@ mit , that there are some golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s i know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans i know .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
there are 6@@ 8 million people esti@@ ma@@ ted to be in wheel@@ cha@@ irs worldwide .
mu@@ st-@@ run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequ@@ ency .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
thank you very much .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
nasa has this phr@@ ase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
we re@@ create the past that people cannot conc@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ eline has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pe@@ g@@ ged it at 100,000 .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
about 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
and as we get older , the na@@ pp@@ ies get bigger .
every day you rele@@ ase + you rele@@ ase in the region of two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us and every day you have to absor@@ b two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
the reasons for writing it .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ing and cars .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very b@@ ad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
and because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
because as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educ@@ ating themselves really well on it .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ zy .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top bal@@ let dan@@ cers -- the é@@ toi@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan in new york and la sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for fl@@ y@@ fire .
he died broken by history .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimul@@ ating conversation .
well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , ss@@ l en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like g@@ mail .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communic@@ ates in a li@@ vely way .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in p@@ ure money market accoun@@ ts .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
the greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
there &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
in a spli@@ t second , i lost all sen@@ sation and movement below my p@@ el@@ v@@ is .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
some re@@ f@@ use to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cru@@ m@@ ble in a fit of dra@@ matic passion .
each society is charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by one primary medium .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .
but how is it with with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adults .
it reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
when i think about creating ab@@ und@@ ance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lux@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
well , i think number one is curi@@ osity .
in a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
b@@ g : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
the shor@@ es are from a different location .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logi@@ cal .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
it was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the pres@@ entation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
the model already takes shape while you &apos;re still in your mother &apos;s wom@@ b and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it fun@@ ctions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
the cha@@ ir@@ man of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the developing world .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
you see , there are two countries that control almost se@@ vent@@ y percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ vo@@ irs worldwide .
because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and charles ken@@ ny that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
