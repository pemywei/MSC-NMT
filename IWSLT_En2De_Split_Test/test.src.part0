no .
no .
yes ?
yes .
maybe not .
that &apos;s the system .
why ?
i &apos;ve got a question .
i &apos;m tom .
that &apos;s very good .
thanks .
really .
after one week .
6@@ 0,000 .
okay .
1.@@ 5 million .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
we &apos;re losing them .
here is the video .
here you see the city .
and that &apos;s important .
that &apos;s efficient .
that &apos;s wrong .
we were poor .
but you know what ?
sustainable .
not very sustainable .
unique .
yes , hell@@ o .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah .
1,000 , very good .
creativity .
he is my grand@@ father .
we love innovation .
what does this mean ?
ta@@ -@@ da !
hey , why not ?
b@@ g : thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
yes , milli@@ seconds .
music as language .
i remember my first fire .
the only country in the world .
this is not ...
we love entertain@@ ment .
hell@@ o !
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
and he says ...
okay . thank you very much .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
it &apos;s a crisis .
but it was very sad .
how do we know that ?
i like things that are different .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
they &apos;re using their hands .
it &apos;s interesting .
why do we do that ?
what does it mean ?
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
my name is am@@ it .
yeah , i know .
i was ama@@ zed .
but the wrong things .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
yeah . okay .
what a fish .
their problem is that they have too little .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
that was us .
we are a smaller brand .
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we know that .
let me show you how they work .
an almost iden@@ tical structure .
but what are we doing with it ?
the whole environmental discussion .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
why not live longer ?
that image remin@@ ded me of something .
we have three main groups .
but what will come in the future ?
tell me about this world .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
crisis . death . disaster .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
pretty simple .
it can know where we are .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
what was the result ?
i never will forget it .
that &apos;s a great question .
the side product is clean water .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
that &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
it is gener@@ ic .
this is hard .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
thank you .
here &apos;s another example .
you need time .
a few less .
that &apos;s sc@@ ary .
does that sound good ?
and that can make a big difference .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
i know what people think when they see this .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but this is domin@@ ant .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
solar technology is ...
architec@@ ts and engineers , th@@ ank@@ fully .
i am a writer .
and let me show you a simple example .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
writing books is my prof@@ ession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
that &apos;s our present .
what did they do ?
from se@@ attle ...
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
i could draw . i could paint .
len@@ to , slow .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
so what happened here ?
how about fit@@ ness ?
thank you so much .
now , what does that mean ?
oh , so jes@@ us , what a thought !
there is no feed .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
you could see manhattan .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
think about your own choices .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
and i understand that .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
thank you very much .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
you have not changed the story .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
through my work i &apos;m trying to artic@@ u@@ late that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
this is a game for outside .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and i was an artist .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
this is really cool . &quot;
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
music is medicine . music changes us .
raise your hands . let me see .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
it feels great .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
because we live on a water planet .
and i grew up in india .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
and this was fascinating .
they really loved it .
and then it happened again .
so here &apos;s another example .
thank you .
he &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
they had a concept of blue blood .
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
but it gets worse .
instead , let &apos;s look to the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
oh , my god .
who@@ a !
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
this is a lot of volu@@ me .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
be a ment@@ or .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
they all matter .
so , what do we have to do ?
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
life hadn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
in other do@@ ma@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
he poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
tell me a little bit about that part .
thank you very much .
can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
but i felt worse .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of a@@ wards .
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and those are the neu@@ ral structures .
and why ? because paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
and it took 18 months .
and it was what i was feeling .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
i will never forget it .
you always lose rare animals .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
our obje@@ ctive was to simply say , okay ,
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
the goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
does anybody know what this is ?
and it was a huge success .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can twi@@ st that around .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
we are depen@@ dent on two countries .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
oh , my god !
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technologi@@ cal definition of platform here .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal computer is a mira@@ cle .
but then reality &apos;s always un@@ predic@@ table .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
j@@ k : both .
i represent children .
so you can have this cloud .
why did i go into medicine ?
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
this is about one percent of the total population .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
five million people use it every month .
so this is a wish .
these guys make money .
we can win back our nutri@@ ents .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
this is a mo@@ dest little ap@@ p .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olymp@@ ics .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
but , but , you know what ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
her father died soon after she was born .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
well , how do we boot up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
you can see on the left side a small boat .
now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
is it something about the light ?
it is nat@@ anz , and it is only nat@@ anz .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
do you know what en@@ vy is ?
and here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
will i like the color ?
here it is .
people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
that &apos;s super important .
well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
it &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
the first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
and it even got better .
ban is blan@@ k .
i don &apos;t love that question .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
my story begins right here actually in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
all right .
what will they consu@@ me ? what will they desire ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
how could we help you ? &quot;
it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
and i thought about that .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
let me tell you a bit about it .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
can i be honest ?
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
this is another look at the tree of life .
and that worked pretty well .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
how many people would choose creativity ?
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be remin@@ ded of how horri@@ ble the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
but it hadn &apos;t .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
yes , there it is .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ bre@@ ze , hall@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
she shares her experience with others .
and so we measu@@ red its motion .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
we can do that .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
thank you for your attention .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
it &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to face .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
and this video is real time .
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
this was the result .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
how do we humans actually function ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
thanks for listening .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard .
and the problem is not technology itself .
a@@ wes@@ ome .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
i want to help you cal@@ m down .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so on .
but what about this day , this one particular fri@@ day ?
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
i don &apos;t know .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i was giving some lec@@ tures in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
say , there are no predic@@ tors .
these will be ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
and in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that purpose , has really changed my life .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
but what are your fish eating ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art being efficient .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ o &apos;s say it .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
&quot; that &apos;s fine , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
and this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
and in ber@@ lin there was this crazy engineering collective .
so what was the next step ?
and women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
so what happens here ?
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
that will take place next apri@@ l .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ ist .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in this way , every conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
this happened around christ@@ mas .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
they had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ples center ...
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
my mother , ma@@ i , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
so just imagine that for a moment .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
i love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
well , what does that mean ?
imagine then just two other little changes .
we took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
and then i can trans@@ fer the whole thing .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
and this made me really sad .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
and now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube .
and that &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
this has nothing to do with science .
and what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
and so they wrote down all these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called it the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
but there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
so here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
when one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
i walked through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
i was trying to preser@@ ve the body .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
in reality the notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ pre@@ cise .
and then we said , okay ,
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
if you are surro@@ unding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
who doesn &apos;t want heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
this is the kan@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
no had never been an option .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adverti@@ sing .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
some have come and gone .
because , you know something ?
if you have something to give , give it now .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
and our nation &apos;s really fo@@ unded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
he had a poten@@ tially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condition called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
something really weird is going on here .
this would have been fine .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
so one citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but government played a key role here .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
it is about how satis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life .
that is a fantastic question .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ckets .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choo@@ sing .
i talk a lot about these issues .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge er@@ ror .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
same thing , only bigger .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and because i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you can enter inside it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the mom@@ a , again in new york .
i fil@@ med in war z@@ ones -- difficult and dangerous .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , so i decided to change that .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
that means we all share a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
all right , let me show you some more about this .
here &apos;s this couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
the second factor is the services we use .
and it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists there isn &apos;t such a test .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intui@@ tive .
and the answer is really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : they are lost forever .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
or , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
it was different in china .
what creates the illusion ?
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
would you like to be more attra@@ ctive and self-@@ confi@@ dent ?
but our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies .
this is a photograph of the object .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and then it went international .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
very sc@@ ary .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stron@@ ger .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
and many people forget this .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
i think this is really cool .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
posi@@ tively .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
centers were establi@@ shed .
it &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
now the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
so when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
so let &apos;s have a look .
thanks for you pati@@ ence .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , reser@@ ved , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
they were moving towards a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept .
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
a few years ago i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese invasi@@ on .
what about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the en@@ ding domin@@ ated .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala sent oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a link to the ted@@ talk .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
thanks .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
okay , there &apos;s some .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
you could have done better .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
and so , we need energy mira@@ cles .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
is it going to be my size ?
they are building an epi@@ c story .
and then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
we have online crimin@@ als .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
the company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
actually no , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house .
so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
the bri@@ cks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it connected those two people .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
they rever@@ sed the flow of water .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
and so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
how about living longer with good health ?
those were the first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
just be who you are .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and many discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thir@@ ty years re@@ gar@@ ding photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
but the reality is far from it .
my grand@@ parents pus@@ hed that number to 70 .
and his answer was yes .
his name is paul off@@ it .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
at least not to navi@@ gate .
to the book and to the image .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is a simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
we can support them in doing good .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
and the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t in relationships . &quot;
this was my first sun@@ burn .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
so temp@@ t is now completely paraly@@ zed .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless .
it &apos;s an independent terri@@ tory . they control all miner@@ al resources .
this is called the e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
they help in the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gressi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
i do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
i began to feel a bit better .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
not even the truth will set them free .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
there &apos;s no normal .
pretty good , right ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
does that make you curious ?
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
well , i was next .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
let me be clear about it . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
and so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
well it was a fri@@ day , this is true .
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of americans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- below an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
it &apos;s not really what is reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think looks reali@@ stic really .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
it &apos;s not a country .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
let me read you the ent@@ ry .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
so let me re@@ mind you .
but they do the job .
and the answer is yes .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
vin@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s invest@@ ing in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
and i felt really good .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
i could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ ami si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them .
and so you have someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , saying : there is nothing more important than stabili@@ sing the human population .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
and every morning i ho@@ p on it .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
and someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more .
we have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
and this is fe@@ li@@ x , actually .
there were still fis@@ hes .
the work of the interpre@@ ter .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
so what happened on this day ?
rec@@ ession . de@@ fau@@ lt . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
thank you .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
good job ! yeah !
because i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
this is the last one .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the des@@ cent of man .
it goes fast .
the vi@@ ral particles then were rele@@ ased from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
which is great , because we need that .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
my fourth techni@@ que : condition for complexity .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
i mean i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
they have similar principles .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
we bran@@ ch off of a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
and it just si@@ ts there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
so , i just started playing .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
she remin@@ ded me that i was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us che@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
this is the source of much of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
we have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
the truth is more like this .
what we want to do is make the future .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mond now .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
the faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight atten@@ dan@@ ts .
it &apos;s a c@@ ute little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and this is why .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
have you seen these guys ?
normally now , i would take the need@@ le out .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
this is happening to us today .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
that really is very important , that we get there .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
and there &apos;s good news here .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but there are two problems with that .
you brought your pictures , right ?
but that &apos;s not protection .
and why is it true ?
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
which was a@@ wes@@ ome .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
here i have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
thank you .
so there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audience .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
here are the results we just ob@@ tain@@ ed .
but what if you want to see br@@ ush stro@@ kes ?
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a reali@@ stic result .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
so i think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair users , but for everyone .
this data was not available before .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
i brought along an example of the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka indi@@ ans .
a lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
we talk about b@@ old , fresh .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
it was , &quot; in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity . forever . &quot;
and here is a surprise .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represent ?
and if you look , for example , in the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
i sometimes push too hard .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is dou@@ bling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the 8@@ 0s .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ cin@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
thank you very much .
in 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
let &apos;s call him don .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance policy .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;ll ever be .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ o@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web page like this .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
it &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
he turns off the eng@@ ines .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit to you that it makes me nervous .
now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road .
the cost of solar dro@@ pped 50 percent last year .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
we have the passion of the di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
and this man came over to me and he hu@@ g@@ ged me .
it was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
we need to get the message out .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
and i want you to see , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is quie@@ tly playing with water .
that was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
totally in@@ efficient .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
if you are happy , you are going to attra@@ ct other happy people to you .
the epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
we have reach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
so that was the reason for the project .
all par@@ ties , all fac@@ tions in society , bac@@ ked this .
but one of them is distin@@ ctly worse than the other .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children in@@ her@@ it the tra@@ its of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
i would like to invi@@ te all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
sun@@ light and co2 is one method ...
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing .
but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ dea@@ vor is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle things , life is a matter of choice .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rect answer .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
and then everybody moved down .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
so the things that make a photograph look reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
they need to tell me about my brand .
the sp@@ inning reser@@ ve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable .
that &apos;s from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i is organi@@ zing at mom@@ a later this year , during the summer .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundre@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
and sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
i want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what i pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
why does this happen in the first place ?
or , are we dest@@ ined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
it causes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
so it &apos;s about effec@@ tivity , not efficiency .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
you &apos;ve got the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , you &apos;ve got the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
and therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a th@@ ie@@ f .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the op@@ tions of it .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and so when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect re@@ a@@ ders all over the world .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
it &apos;s to supp@@ le@@ ment the experience .
what do you think happens next ?
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and orange is wire .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
but we know very little about where things go .
today i &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
i can speed up the whole sequence by ti@@ l@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
i mean think of it , when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
you can play with a different type .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
okay , a bit more .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in tw@@ ent@@ y years .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ulti@@ mate respect for an audience .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
and i talked them into fund@@ ing an expedi@@ tion .
so we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ?
this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing everything , knowledge , and making that acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
so maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
the internet and its services are a mira@@ cle .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
my cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
so what happened years after@@ ward ?
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
we try to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but the point is to have a big foot@@ print that &apos;s of use .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
the experi@@ en@@ cing self has no voice in this choice .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
yes , so to speak .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
and a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
here you have this mechan@@ ism , with which we can use the lie as a gran@@ dio@@ se invention to stabili@@ ze our living conditions .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
in terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
so let me rec@@ ap .
it is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le still being put together .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe rec@@ order .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temp@@ t &apos;s room .
people wra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ fs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly clever individual .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him on his way .
i went to prison -- difficult .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
it was four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
her mother raised her alone .
and other another example are the ambi@@ ent , intelligent systems .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
that &apos;s god , you know .
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a whit@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
but the point is , we still come to gala@@ pa@@ gos .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
if you burn natural gas , no .
and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes down by over nin@@ et@@ y percent .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray and sat around her cas@@ ket .
and after , as i refle@@ cted on that , i decided to elimin@@ ate negative energy from my life .
that does not hold for emotions .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on janu@@ ary fourth and fif@@ th .
what am i going to look at ?
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
now we do the same with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bom@@ b .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
so , this crazy story might be true .
how many do@@ ors does the house you live in have ?
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , you are actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
it was a store called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limit@@ s us is our imagination .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ eline !
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical di@@ visi@@ ons that make sense to me and that i think we should re@@ tain .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
and six@@ te@@ en milli@@ seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ astern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
and it op@@ ens up a map .
i knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
so in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look reali@@ stic ?
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most hon@@ our@@ able thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
these are cell phones of the future .
listen consci@@ ously and say whether you like its taste or not .
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
they can express their opini@@ on on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and mobile ap@@ p , called citizens connect .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mr@@ s. po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
we want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of inv@@ ent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
those are spaces that are able to re@@ act to a human intelli@@ g@@ ently .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
from the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
and the answer is no .
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies ad@@ ded .
even cat@@ s were watching this video .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
the united states now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
and he actually says it that way .
because to me it means memory .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its is open-@@ source .
last year , bear vas@@ que@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had shot outside his home in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
quite a few more .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
so they know everything .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
the three words are : do you remember ?
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
it makes them feel good . &quot;
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to com@@ mit ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
this is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have b@@ ones .
this isn &apos;t about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
so this is a story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
de@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
on this island , that &apos;s the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on a@@ z@@ or@@ es .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ tages .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
but it does require a lot of planning .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
we &apos;re seeing this process fe@@ eding back on itself .
now , we love to wra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and there are several reasons for this .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skep@@ tical .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m opening it .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
let me give you an example .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anima@@ te objects feel the same way .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
if i invi@@ te you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a p@@ ill with offen@@ b@@ ach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
the arc@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
so they go around and do art instal@@ lations like this .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refle@@ ctive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
these theor@@ em@@ s are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
aw@@ w , thank you .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
if you burn coal , no .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put up online .
my wife told me it .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
thank you so much for inv@@ enting behavi@@ oral economics .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
we told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ g@@ ger .
thank you .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ nes and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
i brought seven pa@@ irs of under@@ pants and that &apos;s it .
how are you going to feed the world ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
and when they are com@@ promis@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
well , that night , everybody went to celebra@@ te in the center .
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ unger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still sta@@ ys there .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism .
they will ta@@ p your internet connection .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
and appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
but with the right design , please .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the first on here is the classi@@ c , apple .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
and those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
we want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
we &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who ma@@ tter@@ ed .
i wanted to support them .
even if you were to sho@@ ot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
and we want to make this material acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contribu@@ ting to bio@@ diversity .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
and how did you feel ?
the match begins -- sil@@ ence .
he said , &quot; yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , sc@@ ra@@ ps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
at this point and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of my grandmother around the house .
and then he ad@@ ded , really quite emotion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
there is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
lights , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
yes , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
and more than anything , are you being the best par@@ ent you can ?
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
sort of .
the typical wal@@ m@@ art today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
i met these guys called gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just regi@@ sters the negative space .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
we did a game called super@@ stru@@ ct at the institute for the future .
they en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives pro@@ posed .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
what they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
very expensive real e@@ state .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not intensi@@ vely .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
and they did .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
that means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of metal is in two different places .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
the secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have discus@@ sions with you .
have you ever seen a climate neu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
which one would you like the most ?
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
three months later i had rel@@ oc@@ ated , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure has continu@@ ed .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
how can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and you can see here too , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i from the min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers , and je@@ t@@ blue .
you look around at all these muse@@ ums here .
when you go running , right , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
over time , we concent@@ rate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
we love technology . we love creativity .
so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it expres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
i made the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the leader of the con@@ gress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could watch the ted@@ talk .
that &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this issue .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the de@@ ck and then was thro@@ wn down .
in the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real living space .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worl@@ ds and not the real world .
all that interests me .
the whole building is made of water .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscop@@ e .
she did it for three years .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
so imagine one heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chr@@ ony .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our bodies en@@ ters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
the politics of fear and an@@ ger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
using a kind of tor@@ ch , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
over here , these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
so not like a de@@ to@@ x .
you can only be climate neu@@ tra@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
so lots of levels of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tra@@ ps .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
why not think about it this way ?
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
you &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
and that &apos;s the proje@@ ction of seeing , feedback , seeing .
the next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
so the a@@ wards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
if there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family , it runs through the women .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , kind of thing .
mean@@ while the ex@@ act same year , at bell lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block .
we can re-@@ inv@@ ent things all over again .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall .
that is exactly what you are doing .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
now this is one of the images .
does anyone see anything specific ?
we can do it differently .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
and the interesting thing about that is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons could be de@@ pic@@ ted through songs .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embra@@ ce a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
and then some very funny things happened .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , nei@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
and we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
i have a company that does design and anima@@ tion , so obviously gra@@ ff@@ iti is definitely an intri@@ cate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
we made an app@@ lic@@ ation for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality , to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensor@@ s stopped working .
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
thanks so much .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
a language is a flas@@ h of the human spirit .
the only thing that i have done is i have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
all right , what is brand ger@@ ry ?
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es with each one specific function .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architec@@ ts , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
say what you feel .
but there &apos;s another thing .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
and he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ oning him in his sleep .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the is@@ lan@@ ders .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
so as you all rec@@ all , what our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were re@@ je@@ cting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
now how could this come about ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
they had been pus@@ hed gene@@ tically .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy the@@ ori@@ sts and an@@ archi@@ sts took over our house .
we need to go for more research fund@@ ing .
i actually am .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
what if you could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or elimin@@ ate stro@@ ke ?
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epi@@ c &quot; the ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
here , let me give you an analog@@ y .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
for her , life had dist@@ ill@@ ed itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in australia .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
there are some innova@@ tions in nuclear : mod@@ ular , liquid .
so we start with a windows dro@@ pp@@ er .
they become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citi@@ zen@@ ship .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line .
and you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k to half of their size .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rect all the er@@ r@@ ors .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
the idea is to circum@@ vent a digital safety system .
and that is radi@@ cally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very ra@@ pid .
and the family gather@@ ed .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
so , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this ?
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and i can tell you that this is a transforma@@ tive experience .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
a lie like that shows you that the li@@ ar himself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ t@@ water , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
here &apos;s the building working .
i swe@@ ar .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dra@@ matically .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1@@ d .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
they actually hurt .
but when combin@@ ing photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever cho@@ se farmer .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
so the idea is , beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life , but actually get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
now , that s@@ hal@@ low history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we re@@ duced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
we &apos;re taking off .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its are aware of each other .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ phan@@ ies .
they raised bee@@ f c@@ attle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t se@@ ttle .
the roof also is covered with water .
but it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
and i had to get out of town .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote reach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
because ta@@ ste@@ makers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel introdu@@ ce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
and what happens when you play a piece today that was origin@@ ally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ?
so in recent years , we have be@@ gun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions no@@ wa@@ days -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic eli@@ te .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
so no more saving , ab@@ sta@@ ining from , avo@@ i@@ ding , re@@ duc@@ ing , no more gu@@ il@@ t management , but intelligent waste .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we are on a planet that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
and she &apos;s hit@@ ting a 25@@ 7 .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
so i think , in conclu@@ sion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
thank you . thank you .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to lo@@ cate in the americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
later i learned that at about this same time , ja@@ vier and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
not long after@@ wards , a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity , forever ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ trage@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
