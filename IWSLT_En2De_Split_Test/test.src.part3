so i went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and then we tried out a whole load of simu@@ lations .
i spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
up at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful , being fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , con@@ temporary , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , ed@@ g@@ y or dar@@ ing like er@@ ro@@ l fl@@ yn@@ n , ni@@ m@@ ble or agi@@ le , pro@@ fan@@ e , dom@@ ine@@ ering , ma@@ gical or my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital do@@ main .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will ar@@ ise .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
and oil will be able to be re@@ placed by other energy sources .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappe@@ ared .
this picture on the left is of bio@@ curious , that &apos;s a ha@@ cker@@ space , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to .
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
see , when you do a google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- this is one of the first images that comes up .
if you put you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
give pe@@ e a chance .
and , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ?
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
in spa@@ in , when a perfor@@ mer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , o@@ le , o@@ le , al@@ la@@ h , magni@@ fi@@ cent , bra@@ vo , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ ble , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
is it logi@@ cal that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
and in a few short years , le@@ go bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , gl@@ u@@ ed to their p@@ cs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
these might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the a@@ ed that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
so the ted@@ talk la@@ id out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
the respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
our system isn &apos;t just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spee@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
i think that inter@@ active media address arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were progra@@ mm@@ ed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be e@@ lic@@ ited through inter@@ active media .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
and i asked last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble that people died because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ ck .
let me give you good close look at this .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimu@@ lation , hearing it , has been very , very energi@@ zing to me .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and in these in@@ stances , the po@@ em would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
oh , that guy .
they knew all the bits and bit@@ es that they had to attack .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
standing before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cla@@ d sho@@ w@@ girl .
i would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
they called me .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the arc@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
in both my vo@@ cation at ro@@ bin hood and my avo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fire@@ fi@@ ghter , i am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness on a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al scale , but i &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gra@@ ce and coura@@ ge on an individual basis .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
i car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ sta@@ irs where i met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ cious dog by the front door .
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , communities of participa@@ tion and un@@ expec@@ te@@ dness .
thir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
this si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it roll@@ s it back@@ wards .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
so we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for fl@@ y@@ fire .
this is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
we negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i looked for new sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
now in fact , you had obje@@ c@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would vent@@ ure to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ et@@ ration of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ f@@ its right now .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
most fe@@ males like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &apos;t actually know my chromo@@ so@@ mal ma@@ ke@@ -up but i think i &apos;m probably typical -- most fe@@ males like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
they le@@ vel@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that ma@@ tter@@ ed was the common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
and i came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if i memor@@ i@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
we have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ ss@@ ful produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
because we want this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being brilliant , des@@ cen@@ ded from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as un@@ predic@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbe@@ ar@@ able for us .
the human ability to ada@@ pt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : this phr@@ ase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automo@@ bil@@ es or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
we can start integr@@ ating electro@@ -@@ mo@@ bility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpo@@ rate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
they look at biological materials in an arti@@ stic way and , yes , also electr@@ onic tin@@ ker@@ ing , and com@@ bine this in a very out@@ land@@ ish way .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water cre@@ ature , we actually embra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
th@@ ank@@ fully , right ?
my state of al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed career staf@@ f , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment .
they sort of go like this .
we only have phosp@@ hor@@ us for two years and phosp@@ hor@@ us min@@ ing worldwide is already em@@ it@@ ting a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
us@@ ability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satis@@ fying way possible .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in ad@@ v@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
she was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volu@@ me si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after mr@@ s. dru@@ cker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergen@@ cy physi@@ cians i know dre@@ ad .
he is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ an@@ ced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upp@@ er ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introdu@@ ction , i must say .
but ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ g@@ in@@ alization .
and let me begin with one example .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
play is the gl@@ ue that bin@@ ds us together .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fu@@ els which are dri@@ ll@@ ed out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &apos;re an island .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the con@@ ception , because if you spend all that time imag@@ ining that con@@ ception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what are arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a travel@@ ing wave re@@ actor .
you need this lie to keep this sha@@ m , this self-@@ de@@ ception , up@@ right .
but here &apos;s the thing that kee@@ ps me up at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
both are vi@@ able ; both take off .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that ma@@ pped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
at the end of each day , i made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
that our visi@@ ons of technology and design and entertain@@ ment and creativity have to be married with visi@@ ons of humanity , compassion and justice .
there was a gather@@ ing of resol@@ ve and a quie@@ t voice saying , &quot; i will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved her@@ s .
so for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip .
they were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were re@@ je@@ cting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very va@@ gue concept of birth@@ right .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cre@@ am wra@@ pping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing brea@@ sts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody fig@@ ures out something &apos;s up here .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
and , being young , i said , expec@@ tation .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
in this mind knowledge was re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .
i call it the ris@@ ing billion .
80 &apos;s re@@ vi@@ val me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappe@@ ars .
according to the auth@@ or of the book the story@@ telling animal , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ tsch@@ all , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the re@@ ception of stories .
to main@@ tain the dialo@@ gue , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
as the note is anything but a pre@@ cise indi@@ cation of the desire of a com@@ pos@@ er , and is , rather , a frame@@ work , i will now u@@ tili@@ se this frame@@ work to fill it with sense and meaning .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
one country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me court be the court of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ cial system there .
and we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
i call this &quot; sh@@ in@@ y tiger . &quot;
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of is@@ lands and so the people had to somehow navi@@ gate through there , from island to island , to find food .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can program that and so you can also ha@@ ck into it , that &apos;s it , and i thought think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to really del@@ ve into that .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ cian to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
you can go all the way through .
so in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intui@@ tive , increasingly natural , more user friend@@ ly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was cho@@ sen as the young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
and if i go a step further in these natural user inter@@ faces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gest@@ ure rather than a mouse and cur@@ sor , then i am even faster and more immedi@@ ate .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cra@@ ck a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , addi@@ tional construction of co@@ al-@@ burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &apos;t have , or gas tur@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not possible .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
we worked well into each night .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
that i can suddenly that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is becoming increasingly ir@@ relevant for success , and us@@ ability is becoming an app@@ lic@@ ation .
you can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
it &apos;s a very rare occasi@@ on that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg roll@@ ing .
those are the people who are at least offi@@ cially regi@@ ster@@ ed on the website , the di@@ y-@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g-@@ website .
and i studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; res@@ iden@@ ce at tor@@ onto general hospital , not far from here .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my fi@@ le .
henry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the x@@ y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted , which mary does not need to worry about .
right now in al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
ad@@ ver@@ sity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cle@@ aner than when it enter@@ ed .
even though choo@@ sing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
and the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting english were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t .
we made this game in 2007 .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstra@@ cting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , pres@@ enting , process@@ ing information .
so now they understand the value of prototyp@@ ing .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
but i car@@ ried on with my work .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
i will cl@@ ari@@ fy this in a moment , however , and will attemp@@ t to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtu@@ ality .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the top@@ ic of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral processes or cognitive er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but pri@@ mar@@ ily at the top@@ ic of the relationship between man and object of course .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
or is it photograph@@ y ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and if you have another opportunity to en@@ act this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don &apos;t re@@ mind them of their self-@@ de@@ ception .
we work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medic@@ ation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasi@@ onal inter@@ ruption of the un@@ inten@@ ded forced rus@@ h to the ex@@ it .
we ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and those were the most primi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t dis@@ ney conc@@ ert hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astron@@ aut , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expec@@ tations about performance .
a gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which sho@@ ots about this far , two centi@@ me@@ tr@@ es or so .
that &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
and of course how design affec@@ ts perception .
so how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of content of character ?
i am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
and then i stuck to it until n@@ ine@@ te@@ en nin@@ et@@ y six and then i became the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world together with the sp@@ in-@@ off q@@ -@@ cells .
that which i just pres@@ ented to you .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
do you know what they call a 300 hit@@ ter in major lea@@ gue baseball ?
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
in both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
so to achieve a reali@@ stic result , i think it comes down to planning .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally com@@ mit su@@ i@@ cide seem to be really und@@ one by their gif@@ ts , you know .
or c , because you were told that you aren &apos;t su@@ it@@ able .
have you ?
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some be@@ er . &quot;
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
so i wear two hat@@ s in most of what i do .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 50@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our finger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
i don &apos;t think so .
how far would you get with that ?
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and everything is either the pac@@ k@@ aging or the cont@@ ents .
the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on .
think of this as the long tail to ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in germany . &quot;
so half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
you see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
another example is so-@@ called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my pres@@ entation , we are physi@@ cally moving in non-@@ exist@@ ent , virtual worl@@ ds there , according to the example of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ck .
you introdu@@ ce a new idea and this is ans@@ wer@@ ed inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with a reaction .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
he says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
it might be the evolutionary orig@@ in of the phr@@ ase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the ball@@ s . &quot;
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of participa@@ tion went down two percent .
there &apos;s nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ology coming on , nan@@ o@@ materials .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commer@@ cially , they start at about four thousand euro@@ s at the least .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would de@@ dic@@ ate ourselves to the next top@@ ic of the future , which , in my opini@@ on , and in our opini@@ on , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this non@@ sense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about stor@@ age .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
those are it has a more ar@@ ty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s are working , together with scientists , on exam@@ ining these technologies and asking questions and process@@ ing the knowledge crea@@ tively , there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions and , well , all sorts of things .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
this is an a@@ ver@@ a@@ ge-@@ size green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to engage during their ha@@ ma@@ ts@@ a initi@@ ation .
i just came back from a community that hol@@ ds the secret to human survival .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the exi@@ sting a@@ partment hol@@ ders .
there will be a whole load of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
so it was curi@@ osity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest goals of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
these guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ opp@@ ing from an infe@@ cted computer .
is it just imag@@ in@@ ary ?
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
the great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
that humans are supposed to have des@@ cen@@ ded from ap@@ es and that , yes , there is at least one ance@@ st@@ or shared by both humans and ap@@ es .
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
but totally effective , right ?
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
that might sound unusual at first .
but our perception , how it dec@@ ei@@ ves us too .
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
they learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
that is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
the sun is ris@@ ing .
in sending her home , i dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
so what you were getting was this : your name here pres@@ ents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depen@@ ding on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but inten@@ se concent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on tac@@ kl@@ ing a really difficult problem .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like that od@@ d , still@@ -@@ scre@@ aming bear .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
they cut out the midd@@ le@@ man , they cut out their agen@@ cies and said , &quot; maybe these agen@@ cies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
and then i went to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ ei@@ gh@@ ties because i wanted to study rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and they didn &apos;t have that in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ astern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of to@@ ma@@ to@@ es .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
and also anything they would con@@ j@@ ure up in their minds today .
and i have to tell you , it was energi@@ zing .
went in , and i started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
le@@ go made it acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , international best@@ s@@ eller thing .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
i encoura@@ ge all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bon@@ d , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n -- in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
so the capacity to play in prototyp@@ e is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams per@@ form .
and our a@@ im was , we wanted to reach se@@ vent@@ y to nin@@ et@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es and then this re@@ main@@ der is still here , the last re@@ main@@ der , the last ten , tw@@ ent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es with , that will will be very , very expensive and gener@@ ating this from bat@@ ter@@ ies won &apos;t work either .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we actually want to reach our goal of tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y , tw@@ ent@@ y percent , tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , thir@@ ty percent etc .
that whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutri@@ tion that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
but the king of si@@ am , he was f@@ ed with al@@ umin@@ um u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
a cru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- b@@ ass , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely rever@@ sed the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .
my first memor@@ ies are from the boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transpor@@ tation , communication have dro@@ pped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ fold .
you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t say that , because that would be a little poli@@ tically in@@ cor@@ rect .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it requi@@ red enormous planning .
i mean , they were so bra@@ ve and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
i had some , your sister had some . have some be@@ er . &quot;
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
the roman@@ s had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
all the rest of that day , that after@@ noon , i had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my sto@@ mach .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
what do you think happened then ?
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ f@@ i works .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it ble@@ e@@ ds it leads , &quot; is very true .
all the adults knew the risks .
but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted colle@@ c@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these thi@@ ck , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- i hat@@ ed them , had names for them . i hat@@ ed them .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
my male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight atten@@ d@@ ant anymore .
like i said , you need about as much time as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g .
this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ eit ; easily dete@@ cted or seen through ; re@@ adi@@ ly understood ; characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility or acc@@ essi@@ bility of information , especially concern@@ ing business practic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
and that is kind of our vision of sensi@@ ble energy use and i am gr@@ ate@@ ful to the cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le institute that they said , use solar power .
it became a gil@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cks and images in my imagination .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and i asked the man@@ ager , &quot; is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
it will start to look more and more like you .
once you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the com@@ position &apos;s creation .
he kept pac@@ ing back and forth .
instru@@ ments have developed .
hu@@ h . hang on a moment .
and in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
it &apos;s completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve , sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
simply by virtu@@ e of the fact that mary was born pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequen@@ cing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
one day , los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ pe@@ z was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
you are virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ing the reality without a computer .
second half . end of normal time .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your i@@ pad out with the video on and through aug@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anima@@ ted pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
so , for better or for worse , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start sing@@ ing on its own .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
can i give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y beat of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that guar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as was@@ hing po@@ w@@ der enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h clo@@ th@@ es at for@@ ty degrees , which are also gene@@ tically optimis@@ ed enzy@@ mes .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
i looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
my heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ yp@@ ical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
even better , it was far@@ m-@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the rene@@ w@@ able sources .
so all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .
not the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
i have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the par@@ ent organization to the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be applied toward my atten@@ dance for next year &apos;s ted .
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are sc@@ ary .
and i was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some metaph@@ or@@ ical fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse .
that &apos;s ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
but i can tell you , even in this light , that li@@ p@@ stick is totally in@@ efficient , but very effective , you see ?
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is -- for the thri@@ ll of discovery , and for that strange bon@@ d that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly kn@@ it team .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
so humans can &apos;t be pig@@ s .
she did it in secret .
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
in the other , i was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally sc@@ ar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
so through this mode of pas@@ sing on the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving something you are experi@@ en@@ cing the brilli@@ ance of the lie .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pre@@ stige to be able to do that .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establi@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ ti@@ mate scientific sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ons about the notion of , basically fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
you create like a water cur@@ tain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
what do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ a@@ c surge@@ on or a nur@@ se prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on , an ob@@ gy@@ n , a par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to be ?
here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have geor@@ die making ...
every note , every phr@@ ase is th@@ us given a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes from what i &apos;ve personally experienced .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spon@@ tane@@ ously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analog@@ ous to sex . &quot;
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she grab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
and these were the things she thought we needed to com@@ mit to .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
a work of art that is never looked at will never ga@@ ther the strength to have an effect .
what i always believe is that if you take chan@@ ces , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most su@@ it@@ able pu@@ ri@@ fication plant is the one in frank@@ fur@@ t .
so that was a very successful ha@@ ck in my opini@@ on .
and then pres@@ ented .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wa@@ fer , and then i just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
in another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that .
everything that &apos;s inside can be u@@ tili@@ zed .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the par@@ king lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .

is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?

or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
beyond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is enter@@ ing our everyday objects .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use tw@@ ent@@ y percent dies@@ el fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
i think the greatest ad@@ ver@@ sity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .

just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ b@@ eit success@@ fully , many generations ago .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what i wanted . &quot;
how big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
now you probably think that the com@@ pos@@ er , when writing down the notes , already inclu@@ des everything they &apos;ve thought of .
you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .

one of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the i@@ pad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
his sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
these changes are coming .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ tili@@ ty of our inter@@ actions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p moving around a flat des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physi@@ cally , ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , pe@@ sti@@ cide run@@ off .

and the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
it &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
we &apos;d only be able to flo@@ at in the earth &apos;s se@@ as as am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no po@@ sters , there &apos;s no fli@@ ers , nothing .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty ar@@ is@@ es from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
two pa@@ irs of stock@@ ings for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le , and it has been very difficult to study them .
but the point is ...
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embra@@ ce gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ origin@@ als .

you know there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
that &apos;s literally co@@ vering just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
there &apos;s nothing po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it .
and that has to do with phosp@@ hor@@ us .
if you think about it , right ?
was a very a very fan@@ cy project .
so we could easily supply the world with do@@ zens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fund@@ ed .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the ad@@ vice that designers must also think differently to arri@@ ve at new solutions , and so i thank you war@@ m@@ ly for your attention and please .
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching const@@ it@@ u@@ tional crisis .
that was a massive out@@ c@@ ry at the time , because of course it was when the li@@ vely language started to mani@@ fest itself in writing , meaning that i took something flu@@ id and alive and started to car@@ ve it in stone and so manipu@@ late it .
direct adverti@@ sing , and not necessarily for the company pu@@ ma , but to help this company make these products successful .
when you then move all your fing@@ ers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then t@@ ones come out , which , together , sound like music .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single spor@@ ts illu@@ strated ever produced .
and , one day , he came in to my s@@ ession -- ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essi@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ mee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
because the fact that i can gra@@ b hold of things like these little pieces , that i can touch them and they come to me , is consi@@ der@@ ably more natural than when i am able to make these things acc@@ essi@@ ble via hier@@ arch@@ ically organis@@ ed web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms so to speak .
and one time we caught a live one .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the notion of happiness .
over the h@@ ills and all that .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simpli@@ city , or alterna@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , how to reach one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
this is a very direct way to get back nutri@@ ents in agriculture .
and as i was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta@@ -@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
unfortunately not the one on offen@@ b@@ ach , but perhaps you can give the frank@@ fur@@ ters a hand .

in fact , i sc@@ ou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper i could .
so the it &apos;s not as efficient , but it &apos;s basically do@@ able .
when pro@@ ctor &amp; amp ; gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bri@@ d@@ ging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occu@@ pi@@ ed for three seconds .
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the sea .
you see ?
we have two beings , both conc@@ ei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously us@@ able , including the i@@ pad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
and the third area spea@@ ks for itself really .
and i understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the ama@@ zon forest alone .
now , if we do a really great job on new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
we &apos;ve been given over ten million fund@@ ed projects , also to atta@@ ch a ten@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ watt battery to the ger@@ man network .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
she was the end of every argument in our family .
it turns out that in weg@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which i try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i memor@@ i@@ zed in my an@@ atom@@ y class the orig@@ ins and exer@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and common .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sele@@ ct government .
and you inje@@ ct it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence si@@ ft@@ able .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with muse@@ ums and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , where we could pre@@ cis@@ ely re@@ constru@@ ct , so to speak , the electrical ra@@ ti@@ o of the island on a one to three scale .
it brings together image and text and anima@@ tion and sound and touch .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .
but somehow we can insu@@ late ourselves from this problem .
now i am also older than ch@@ op@@ in when he wrote the piece at thir@@ t@@ y-@@ two .
and he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
these devices aren &apos;t acc@@ essi@@ ble to people . &quot;
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones , extremely dist@@ ant ones , for professional staf@@ f , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with a doctor &apos;s degree et@@ c. only .
looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style assem@@ bly language .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
as of next week , it will soon be available .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and you really have to stay pretty fir@@ m while doing so , but i think it &apos;s it &apos;s possible .
it is possible though .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bo@@ und@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for am@@ use@@ ment pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
you had to regi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
we &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
that was then re@@ placed by the classi@@ cal age and the first type of abstra@@ ction .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , sur@@ ely what charles has written is not true .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
thank you very much , guys .
and any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ od@@ y-@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspe@@ cts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in com@@ bat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
and if i say to someone , pass me the s@@ alt or the pe@@ pp@@ er , they &apos;d have to first think about what &apos;s in what with the right one .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapi@@ dly .
and that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
in this country , as many as 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of pre@@ vent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors .
so an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then spre@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institution of government .
i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it plays .
the re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
fir@@ stly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of ex@@ cre@@ tions you have , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your po@@ tty and sti@@ r its cont@@ ents , your curi@@ osity is of course a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed .
my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i deliver the goods .
and as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine -- to make this swi@@ mming po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped hole underneath the device .
and i would please like the record to refle@@ ct today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
that is i think they are less people have regi@@ ster@@ ed than actually exist .
creates a bon@@ d , creates a bon@@ d of respect .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support .
re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really magni@@ fi@@ cent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
and then we took apart a d@@ v@@ d bur@@ ner and took out the bur@@ ner the las@@ er and then tried to focus on this camera .
and who could have predi@@ cted any of this ?
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vi@@ ral video , bear .
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty jum@@ ped up and he ran over to this older black man .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inje@@ ct this into a patient ...
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . police pe@@ pp@@ er spra@@ y .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
so &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed anima@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
this is &quot; the star@@ ry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
he &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hop@@ eless can@@ di@@ date .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relev@@ ance in the area of in the research area us@@ ability and especially in the area user experience .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an in this , you know it .
and then it &apos;s less us@@ able or user friend@@ ly .
it was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fund@@ ing for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
i have a nice , con@@ cre@@ te example to illu@@ strate this .
and then se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ g@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
in 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pris@@ ons .
and the list can go on forever .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
finally : epi@@ c meaning .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , carb@@ -@@ fest and all@@ -@@ night s@@ essi@@ ons , tony dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
nothing will happen .
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
perhaps you could just brie@@ fly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re te@@ sted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
here we have a the pro@@ of , by the way , that humans are not pig@@ s .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
and the conversation i had with de@@ an kamen this morning , one of the great di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called sl@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
and i made myself a bar@@ gain that if only i re@@ double my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
so we do need target theor@@ ies that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the po@@ uring rain , under an um@@ br@@ ell@@ a , in her pa@@ jam@@ as , bar@@ e@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
and fun@@ ni@@ ly enough it was developed at the b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , called ab@@ b today , in the se@@ venti@@ es , and was then licen@@ sed to the japanese .
in the beginning there was the tri@@ b@@ al society , charac@@ ter@@ is@@ ed by language .
the dog ! i was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
and it was my job , when the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f called for a car@@ di@@ ology consu@@ lt , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
whether the music is too pe@@ p@@ per@@ y or swe@@ et for your taste .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high tru@@ ck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under . &quot;
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
now , having sel@@ ec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
it &apos;s like experi@@ en@@ cing a happy new day af@@ res@@ h , even though you go through the same ritu@@ als , getting up , having break@@ fast , going to work , i experience the same piece an@@ e@@ w again and again .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
another thing from the usa that also had to do with pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test thing , is the the p@@ c@@ r , the poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction , a complicated term .
he had x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high ge@@ ar that it created , essentially , a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environment .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
there &apos;s the a direct re@@ turning system for this .
there is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
we can take a look at that now .
which of course very much ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ es for story@@ telling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
i wrote down four key@@ words and would like to explain them brie@@ fly .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
the tough thing is building the pilot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
secon@@ d@@ hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let .
then i took a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser and connected it to that .
what is particularly impres@@ sive in the area of inter@@ active media is the fact that we &apos;ve an@@ ch@@ or@@ ed the ability to think in a non-@@ lin@@ ear way in our biological memory .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ est@@ ers &quot; by pie@@ ter bru@@ e@@ gel at the met .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising -- like bar@@ n raising , but with a cloud .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
he transl@@ ated the water@@ li@@ lies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment .
my hun@@ ches again .
the nice thing about this top@@ ic is that on this island , you can basically anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es .
like twice over .
so what why ha@@ cking ?
i was given the gift of a mira@@ cle , of not dying that day .
we look into this network , see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if it turns into for@@ ty nine point nine her@@ tz , we start to open a few small val@@ ves , then a little more ste@@ am can enter , and then it goes up again .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
so you have to exam@@ ine what that means , and not only change it so that it &apos;s different , because it needs to be impro@@ ved too .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
i mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
that &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on about progress .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get sel@@ ec@@ ted out .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the cent@@ u@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dri@@ ll into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
and this resul@@ ted in the first soft@@ -@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
tradition@@ ally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
we set up a little ta@@ sting bo@@ oth right near the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store .
now it &apos;s only at pre@@ cise times when they al@@ ig@@ n .
by the way , about one hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts electrical out@@ put on dies@@ el fuel basis is ad@@ ded in the world per year .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the states .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
but when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling c@@ at li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
they &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay choo@@ sing -- pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
so , okay , to ha@@ ck into biology , you need material .
in those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participa@@ tion rates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ cial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
so , for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
so find the programs that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
i was the guy be@@ aten up b@@ loo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
yet i am afraid of privi@@ lege , of e@@ ase , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
so the system is evol@@ ving to create bac@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to dete@@ ct those mistakes that humans inevi@@ t@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of ja@@ m if they en@@ counter@@ ed six than if they en@@ counter@@ ed 24 .
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the lung , the l@@ ung@@ s fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstra@@ ction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging a different , color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occasi@@ on .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a for@@ um , where you where people can meet and disc@@ uss things online .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pus@@ hed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
there are different gra@@ des here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passi@@ vely or whether you can also ac@@ tively speak it , all the way to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le ?
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
its flexi@@ ble design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cra@@ w@@ ls and high-@@ agi@@ li@@ ty mov@@ ements .
with its complete transpar@@ ency , which is the new kind of thinking that clas@@ hes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the las@@ ag@@ ne and not bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , because i want to cover that up and not conf@@ ess to it .
and that &apos;s when m@@ s. car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
so given a do@@ zen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
so those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the com@@ pos@@ er at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
and when you see how far re@@ moved we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , has a program to be climate neu@@ tra@@ l by tw@@ ent@@ y for@@ ty , right ?
the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
so it &apos;s a circle .
speci@@ alized skills and facili@@ tation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success .
and as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke input data is actually pr@@ er@@ e@@ cor@@ ded by stu@@ x@@ net .
so i felt like our cell@@ phones and our fan@@ cy wat@@ ches and our c@@ ameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
and this turns up not only in art , but also in fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , in in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and cla@@ ims and is th@@ us of un@@ sound mind .
i can trans@@ fer this performance model ori@@ ent , sele@@ ct , in@@ form , trans@@ act to an interaction system .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we ex@@ ec@@ ute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vic@@ tim is white than if the vic@@ tim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is black and the vic@@ tim is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapi@@ dly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero .
and people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ged .
so it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
and i went sa@@ il@@ ing on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the ja@@ va sea .
that &apos;s where the dra@@ matic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical pal@@ ette will have many more nu@@ an@@ ces of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an et@@ ch a sk@@ et@@ ch .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned letter on each si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it che@@ cks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
because it &apos;s in that ne@@ x@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
so we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
ladies and gentle@@ men , meet your cou@@ s@@ ins .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of dna .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the-@@ record conversation . &quot;
that &apos;s what the nor@@ m says .
just because of that .
bus@@ h@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small sta@@ dium with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mira@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow lab@@ rad@@ ors that i know that are more capable of in@@ formed , intelligent , ma@@ ture decisions about sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
with people , it is rele@@ ased in the ur@@ ine .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
it is about taking that which was sc@@ ar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hell@@ o , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it : fish far@@ ms po@@ ll@@ ute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
in it , there are always three dies@@ els running , two are always main@@ tain@@ ed .
switch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the surro@@ unding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the di@@ stra@@ ctions of construction .
in both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
and then we look at cases like what happened in dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
you put a box like this over there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
and when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and then it goes back to the back and it &apos;s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
the point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally fe@@ e@@ ds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
all one &apos;s own music is destro@@ yed because you &apos;re constantly being bom@@ bar@@ ded by music from outside of yourself .
you can also try it with words like re@@ ven@@ ge or ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and the like .
my du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ cre@@ te way .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanis@@ ms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advan@@ ces in computers .
and within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
he was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
there are contro@@ versi@@ al top@@ ics such as all those gene@@ tically modi@@ fied plants in the fields .
now i will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challen@@ ging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of ris@@ c micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
this is about the cop@@ ying of genes , repli@@ c@@ ating genes , dna , frag@@ ments , so that you can make them visible .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and laun@@ ch k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the i@@ pad .
and to see when something is intui@@ tive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friend@@ ly , so as intui@@ tive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horri@@ ble situations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine socie@@ tal issues in a way that make them eng@@ aging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertain@@ ing and acc@@ essi@@ ble to an audience .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be refle@@ cted by us as opportunity costs .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limit@@ s on screen real e@@ state .
so he starts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ iety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
and it &apos;s easily pro@@ ven that he has something entirely different in mind .
so a lot more naturally , and though they &apos;re in a contain@@ er , i can directly see which one con@@ tains s@@ alt and which one con@@ tains pe@@ pp@@ er .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
you have to be able to c@@ ater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
sound familiar ? right .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this si@@ x-@@ pack of be@@ er -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent tour .
we need to have this dialo@@ gue be a more rational , more under@@ stand@@ able dialo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
for every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rele@@ ased from death row .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
what happens is this .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
but something stupid like a solar pen@@ dul@@ um , which has an out@@ put of something like one hundred watt per square me@@ tr@@ e , that was a to@@ y .
but the point is to always find a a really loo@@ se approach to it , to deal with it play@@ fully .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ hed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ us@@ hed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
it always makes for a happy conc@@ ert when i have the fortun@@ e to experience the piece an@@ e@@ w , even though i &apos;ve been working on it for so long in ad@@ v@@ ance .
you want boot cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; on and on he went .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for mana@@ gers to come in , and also an ex@@ ternal legal system .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutri@@ ents .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
it was bus@@ y , i was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
except they can if they ha@@ ck into a foreign c@@ .@@ a .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ ver@@ sity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
and that era of terror@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of ra@@ cial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and i got in my car and i went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
people believed that creativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ it@@ ation .
she &apos;s one of the organi@@ z@@ ers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a pres@@ entation and present my idea .
there &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at ? &quot;
so you could call it the trans@@ lation of a trans@@ lation .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the nat@@ anz ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facili@@ ty .
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular jo@@ es .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
and yes , the discussion always revol@@ ves around how much of the future you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and so in this sense we &apos;re coming together , also if you look at the pres@@ entation by pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that it &apos;s okay to be a collective and use solar power .
just like it used to happen in the village .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
i took the liber@@ ty i asked li@@ l@@ ly , if it would be okay to mention her .
i was se@@ vent@@ e@@ en when i took part in a course of his and played the last of ch@@ op@@ in &apos;s four bal@@ la@@ ds , one of his later works .
you read letters , di@@ aries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expres@@ sed by the com@@ pos@@ er themselves .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
so there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
whereas .
at that time , there were self-@@ gover@@ ning companies and one of them was in kreu@@ z@@ berg in mehr@@ ing@@ h@@ of , where people thought evil took place .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the person behind pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a that he re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t@@ ated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing was bad .
thank you for sc@@ aring the living da@@ y@@ lights out of us . thank you , r@@ al@@ ph .
those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very ni@@ c@@ ely together .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
you will then rather have to go to a seas@@ onal reser@@ vo@@ ir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
i was just asked whether this s@@ ack is a talking s@@ ack and will talk for me .
i was terri@@ fied by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without t@@ we@@ eting it to my friends .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
soc@@ rates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adverti@@ sing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
they &apos;re on the ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h ti@@ ps , but also el@@ se@@ where in the landscape , right ?
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
already in some s@@ hal@@ low la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is ac@@ tively bub@@ bling up out of the water .
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
wealth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy prote@@ sting bi@@ cycle fin@@ es in new york city , i ad@@ mit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can rele@@ ase the power of so many more children , and invi@@ te them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distin@@ ct , but comple@@ ment@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milli@@ seconds .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire bri@@ ga@@ de , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
so that &apos;s currently the the core obje@@ ctive of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ bility , so that that more people can get involved .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
it &apos;s a so@@ le@@ m@@ n part .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating our knowledge on a global level and we &apos;re acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating it increasingly quick@@ er and better , for example .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all i put in my su@@ it@@ case .
save those . kill off the rest .
and it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the ka@@ is@@ ut desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the and@@ es , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ dent@@ ally the fellow that i travel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
all right , let &apos;s go .
so i can dri@@ ll into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
so , as a designer , i design behavi@@ our much more much more often than appe@@ ar@@ ance .
and i would like to invi@@ te everyone to work on it and event try something y@@ ourselves .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps for@@ gotten , and what is instin@@ ctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
imagine him as the comm@@ uni@@ sts enter sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
but it &apos;s an essential compon@@ ent , if you want to design things as intui@@ tively as possible .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
she had ir@@ rever@@ si@@ ble brain damage .
unlike the sett@@ led midd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , whose existence i was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in foot@@ sc@@ ray .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
at one point , ja@@ vier said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bas@@ sy -- give some to the u.s. em@@ bas@@ sy ; give some to the can@@ adi@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those em@@ bas@@ sy gro@@ unds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as and then disappe@@ aring for days , wander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ as@@ hed upon him .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly describe .
if we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , brilliant , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musi@@ cian .
what happened is the the so-@@ called machine age .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from magic .
yes , hell@@ o .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions ; why does someone spend such hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous su@@ ms of money on such a little bag that you can har@@ dly fit anything into , even when it &apos;s not very practical ?
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
once it &apos;s played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder .
in california there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ pack .
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stit@@ ution with its people .
the bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
wonderful , right ?
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
i probably bel@@ ong , are those two friend@@ ly girls still here , i probably bel@@ ong to the generation that created this bad e@@ col@@ o@@ gical image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in kar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he in n@@ ine@@ te@@ en se@@ vent@@ y nine , i think it &apos;s called k@@ it today .
this is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
and i saw mr@@ s. dru@@ cker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
beginn@@ ers &apos; clas@@ ses har@@ dly talk about interpretation .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
if you complete the game you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social inno@@ v@@ ator , class of 2010 .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
so scot@@ t gets this call .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ oles@@ ome . &quot;
you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then i shot at oni@@ ons and made them light up and stuff like that .
one i thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
that was also an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t at the time , where the gent@@ ry , c@@ ler@@ gy@@ men and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally f@@ at@@ al of course .
we &apos;re more on the symbo@@ lic , on the se@@ man@@ tic level there , something we designers are also pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed with .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequ@@ ins go with everything .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &apos;s also found in the electr@@ on@@ ics sector where you also find a whole tin@@ ker@@ er scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circu@@ its .
where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the south african run@@ ner , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the international games in ber@@ lin .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communic@@ ating .
the second theor@@ em is th@@ us , if kl@@ aus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
those wir@@ es carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
and if you den@@ y people the if you den@@ y people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren &apos;t here at all , people become grab@@ by and ho@@ sti@@ le .
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
they spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sti@@ cks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
we have the tools with this exponenti@@ al technology .
that &apos;s rather sad for the ha@@ cker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
people in the satelli@@ te room are starting to move in now .
he &apos;s wa@@ sting his time on non@@ sense .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , green@@ land .
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
we called it digital water pa@@ vili@@ on .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
and two days later i came to do my next emergen@@ cy shift , and that &apos;s when my ch@@ ie@@ f asked to speak to me quie@@ tly in her office .
that &apos;s the kind of sh@@ ame that is a teacher .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ sity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lic and can survive at the ste@@ am vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , s@@ ous@@ -@@ vi@@ de coo@@ ked fish , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that a hospit@@ able environment for them .
now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ matically less than a power plant .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ eing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ e@@ ster@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and if you put it exactly between two equ@@ ally big ha@@ y@@ stac@@ ks , it will star@@ ve .
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier which will be hydro@@ gen me@@ than@@ e , power to gas you know al@@ r , that &apos;s what it will be .
or d , you simply don &apos;t like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
it would be so energi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , but also in science .
and during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty s@@ her@@ i@@ ff who was offen@@ ded that the jan@@ it@@ or had come into court .
we &apos;re challen@@ ging teams around the world to basically com@@ bine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a@@ .@@ i@@ . , you can c@@ ough on it , you can do a finger blood pri@@ ck .
and he &apos;s spee@@ ding along , and all of a sudden he he@@ ars this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tali@@ zing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into existence .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
embra@@ ce fear . embra@@ ce risk .
the artist is con@@ ve@@ ying something you can only get to know once you &apos;ve looked at the work of art again and again .
because you can &apos;t smell the flo@@ wers in the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , you can &apos;t guess the sha@@ de of green , you can &apos;t hear or feel the wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing of the wind .
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
and our european energy grid basically consi@@ sts of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the ax@@ le always revol@@ ves around the whole of europe .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , house of natural fi@@ bers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
and we simul@@ ated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conven@@ tional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fif@@ ty cents per k@@ w@@ h after tw@@ ent@@ y years , you &apos;d arri@@ ve at about fort@@ y-@@ four cents .
here is the real fl@@ y@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
and we ro@@ unded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pet for as far as you could see .
the question is just , calcu@@ late that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to mor@@ ally justi@@ fy something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
we &apos;re actually proje@@ cting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the vot@@ ing rights act .
henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , bi@@ ologi@@ cally , except in terms of when he was born .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the sp@@ an of milli@@ seconds in which these things happen .
o@@ sit in itself is used by us fif@@ ty to se@@ vent@@ y thousand times depen@@ ding on the activity , it was as@@ certain@@ ed that when you sleep it is stra@@ ined less than in the day .
and before i knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ stry , c@@ ement .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glas@@ ses .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
so these were my prime mo@@ tives .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading liter@@ ature from that period .
all of na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ si@@ ls .
it &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
if they get surro@@ unded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
i or@@ dered a kid@@ ney x-@@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my collea@@ gue who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower quad@@ rant and called the surge@@ ons .
he says , &quot; bra@@ ce for impact . &quot;
and for example , the most sophisti@@ cated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
it &apos;s completely direc@@ ted .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often norm@@ alized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
at various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually add@@ ressed to me .
now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ hol on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
so for those people who did choose to participa@@ te , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
that could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a g@@ arb@@ age can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it .
and every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemicals within them .
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from syn@@ thetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstra@@ ct code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cyber@@ ne@@ tic .
a group from ank@@ ar@@ a , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to in@@ form the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organis@@ ed these these little actions at street festi@@ v@@ als and tried to explain dna to people .
one should eat the food that is lo@@ v@@ ingly coo@@ ked by a co@@ ok , not just look at it or pass on the reci@@ pe for it .
software ha@@ ck@@ ers started building computers in the se@@ venti@@ es and ei@@ gh@@ ties and this gave rise to the internet .
i know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
a big fis@@ her@@ y was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
intui@@ tive us@@ ability didn &apos;t start to become an element@@ ary economic factor , an element@@ ary success factor , when apple appe@@ ared on the scene , if i wanted to make technologi@@ cal devices us@@ able for people .
are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophisti@@ cated like 00@@ 7 ?
these na@@ pp@@ ies are everywhere prac@@ tically .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
why should i worry ?
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
arch@@ a@@ ic models are models that we adop@@ ted in pre-@@ industrial times .
are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te ? are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves .
it will get to you .
and there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ eding growth where you go by orders of magni@@ tude every few years .
now , this is an inter@@ active carto@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
at the end you want to susta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
the second story , also to illu@@ strate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wa@@ i@@ st@@ line .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-@@ na@@ pp@@ y stage , so to speak .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ r@@ . acting as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bas@@ s@@ ist whose promis@@ ing career was cut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed ste@@ ad@@ y since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
so that what they had only con@@ ju@@ red up in their minds becomes listen@@ able .
you can zo@@ om around very simply .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
now the fish is on the i@@ u@@ c@@ n red list .
story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sensor@@ ial .
i didn &apos;t know the proto@@ col@@ s .
i always keep my thes@@ au@@ rus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no .
incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn &apos;t at all .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll exp@@ and in a similar way and also be simil@@ arly net@@ worked , so that more people can get involved .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quot@@ ation mar@@ ks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to brie@@ fly mention a project .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ ver@@ sity as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
and that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
and there were rare but se@@ aring chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the occasi@@ onal gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; asi@@ an , go home . &quot;
he showed it to ja@@ vier .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
and this this ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-@@ industrial times bit@@ ter@@ ly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
he then made this this this hel@@ met , and it took place in in co@@ operation with the museum .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same ca@@ ve or another place together , build cities and villa@@ ges and basically created this tri@@ b@@ al society .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corpo@@ rate ex@@ ecu@@ tive . &quot;
and i went through the same period of sh@@ ame and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
the disaster is for that two billion .
so as a citi@@ zen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
and if you want to ex@@ ce@@ ed tw@@ ent@@ y , thir@@ ty percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , you have to switch off dies@@ el .
there &apos;s also an extra associ@@ ation , the cra@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ cra@@ d@@ le-@@ institute , where everybody can get involved .
we there put out six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of ja@@ m , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sam@@ ple some ja@@ m ?
so every morning i ho@@ p on my wi@@ f@@ i scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
and the emer@@ g@@ . staf@@ f pulled out all the st@@ ops .
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spo@@ ken language .
his personal impres@@ sions of the water@@ li@@ lies .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ cian had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fi@@ ction book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and satis@@ fied , in a narra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integra@@ te the two .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stron@@ ger , with more stam@@ ina .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vi@@ br@@ ating , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ and@@ ing and contra@@ cting bel@@ lo@@ ws .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
and i wo@@ und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russi@@ a , going through the pre-@@ co@@ s@@ mon@@ aut bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
transl@@ ating from ger@@ man into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the trans@@ lation of liter@@ ature or even poetry .
i would like to explain this mechan@@ ism to you today and make it a little more acc@@ essi@@ ble to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an un@@ conscious level .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
the cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
so , i was completely s@@ mitten by this , and had to do more .
that &apos;s the medium of print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that i do .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
words , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
right , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ise my my pres@@ entation by stat@@ ing that the characteri@@ stics and abilities that we ac@@ qui@@ red during the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be re@@ activ@@ ated with the help of the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technologi@@ cal , new products .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ini@@ zing hor@@ m@@ one .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
so give me a hand here .
and the fis@@ her@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in ghana .
think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
that might sound m@@ und@@ an@@ e at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went del@@ ved into it more .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even guess at .
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
and the commercial device for this starts at about fif@@ te@@ en thousand euro@@ s or so , whereas whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ers cost about fif@@ ty euro@@ s .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
one of two things is going to happen .
we can see it again here we can see the dies@@ el again here , and all the individual ag@@ gre@@ gates here .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the ei@@ gh@@ ties .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fir@@ es as the assi@@ stant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
it &apos;s about making a bene@@ ficial po@@ op print .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news , videos , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transpor@@ tation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
i &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully con@@ struc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analog@@ y to it .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
that means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted sa@@ f@@ ely , hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an x@@ y chromo@@ so@@ mal basis , and that s@@ ry gene on the y chromo@@ some tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads , which we all have in the fe@@ tal life , to become te@@ stes .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
i sell pet to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the ex@@ ception of my physical therapy s@@ essi@@ ons .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
what scri@@ p@@ ts could you have written that would have contain@@ ed this in it ?
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ es with this pre@@ mis@@ es , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini@@ -@@ laboratory , took a pressure coo@@ ker , a hot pla@@ te and , yes , sou@@ p stock , and b@@ red bacteria with it , working like this .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ on@@ gst this tech@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ ky internet culture .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re han@@ ging in there .
everybody was having some ca@@ ke earlier .
and they have there were two two tin@@ ker@@ ers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and che@@ aper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so fre@@ ely available hard@@ ware and electr@@ on@@ ics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ri@@ pe for the market and are currently the the che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ rest@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ sto@@ m with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; o@@ le , o@@ le , o@@ le , &quot; which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .
depen@@ ding on how and when i car@@ ve , a very different kind of co@@ verage comes into being compared to when someone expres@@ ses it in a li@@ vely form , so to speak .
if that &apos;s our thinking from from the cra@@ d@@ le to the gra@@ ve , then our our entire planet will become a ce@@ me@@ tery so@@ on@@ er or later .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hit@@ ting that de@@ fau@@ lt butt@@ on over and over and over again .
i gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mm@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
so you agree to dig it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
it &apos;s a type of terri@@ tor@@ ial behavior , right ?
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , in@@ c . right ?
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s non@@ sense , a play@@ thing for kids , we calcul@@ ated everything , it will never add up .
br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ ord here .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resi@@ dent .
he types &quot; o@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly con@@ vi@@ cted .
some of my do@@ o@@ zi@@ es have been in the last five years .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le .
vi@@ cious car@@ tel@@ s . announ@@ cer five : cau@@ stic cru@@ ise lines .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
again , people of color appe@@ aling to a common@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y over a difference of an@@ atom@@ y , again , success@@ fully .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become something alien to us
my obje@@ ctive is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , for@@ ty years of the-@@ clu@@ b@@ -@@ of-@@ ro@@ me , into quality .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
the const@@ ant f@@ loo@@ ding of music today is not very bene@@ ficial there .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participa@@ te .
because with pig@@ s , phosp@@ hor@@ us is rele@@ ased in their soli@@ d components fa@@ e@@ ces .
today they &apos;re called project ex@@ ecu@@ ting organizations .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
i have this cognitive feedback , you proje@@ cted something you want to see .
go@@ od@@ night swe@@ et o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
you can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have br@@ us@@ hed up against that thing , at times .
that probably doesn &apos;t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your emplo@@ yer or who@@ ever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
so , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
no kid@@ ding .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
well dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a c@@ .@@ a .
one big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embra@@ ce risk .
what is the sou@@ l ?
you were you were invited to dinner , not to ste@@ al nutri@@ ents .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fi@@ ction part of it .
and when i say &quot; computer game &quot; , you probably are imag@@ ining a number of person@@ s people jum@@ ping around in front of some game con@@ sol@@ es or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game con@@ so@@ le .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
that means that once a child has reach@@ ed the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life recei@@ ving stories .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
there was no key@@ board instrument such as the piano in b@@ ach &apos;s time .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your sha@@ ving machine in the car via a small power in@@ ver@@ ter .
it sorts and sc@@ ours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
it basically bo@@ ils down to the bus@@ he@@ hr nuclear power plant and to the nat@@ anz fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a goo@@ se with a stick on sh@@ ro@@ ve tu@@ es@@ day .
that was really intui@@ tive , i mean , everyone expres@@ sed their wi@@ sh@@ es , their and things that move them .
it brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
i spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pris@@ ons , on death row .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intui@@ tive or naturally mana@@ ge@@ able as possible .
no one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
yes , well ...
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
and there is this stun@@ ning sil@@ ence .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a sou@@ p gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
only things that are subject to wear and te@@ ar , such as sho@@ e sol@@ es , bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings , car ty@@ r@@ es , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
the law of pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity , the law of of continu@@ ity , etc .
after a while , you already have a vast reser@@ vo@@ ir of knowledge surro@@ unding the com@@ pos@@ er as an interpre@@ ter , and you listen to them regul@@ arly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the com@@ pos@@ er .
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
up ti@@ ll now the following is always argu@@ ed in discus@@ sions , these is@@ lan@@ ders are becoming self-@@ suff@@ i@@ cient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our jo@@ int network .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exi@@ sted ?
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven offi@@ cially re@@ co@@ g@@ nis@@ ed senses , and in the near future the next , the ei@@ gh@@ th sense will probably be ad@@ ded to it and as an exten@@ sion of ourselves again .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
with time , you will have dem@@ ands and will want to have more sp@@ ices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bio@@ - d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g , di@@ y bi@@ o .
and imagine if you would a@@ .@@ i@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
you should ask for some of that .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friend@@ ly , so that anybody can use it ?
today i &apos;d like to verb@@ ally trans@@ late what i usually trans@@ late into music , or interpre@@ t .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an ee@@ g or something like that , so he was working with neuro@@ biology , his his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
because technologi@@ cally it &apos;s just not possible .
it &apos;s both 3d scan@@ ning in real time and motion capture .
and how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
china can make up for that in one second .
you can explain this much more el@@ abor@@ ately later on , as there &apos;s more much more to this .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requi@@ red of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
but there &apos;s a lot of wa@@ sted transpor@@ tation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening .
thinking , you know , two percent .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and tre@@ ating them .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an to the front .
i &apos;d completely closed the loo@@ p between being the science fi@@ ction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
and part of the narra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
fish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fis@@ her@@ s and this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bi@@ cycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they vic@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed .
fr@@ ance sc@@ or@@ es . it@@ al@@ y sc@@ or@@ es .
in offen@@ b@@ ach , for example , tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the amount of waste produced by hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds consi@@ sts of na@@ pp@@ ies .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
zero emissions , you see ?
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
so appar@@ ently humans don &apos;t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent , promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ ex@@ ual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
by being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
you want butt@@ on fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? you want st@@ one@@ was@@ hed or aci@@ d-@@ was@@ hed ?
before this , we were in the so-@@ called age of feu@@ d@@ alism .
and what we did , the hall was comple@@ ted in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and t@@ wel@@ ve , we developed prac@@ tically everything that could be developed electr@@ on@@ ically and in terms of software between the individual systems .
am@@ anda is wearing our ele@@ gs set .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the obje@@ ctive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive socie@@ tal opini@@ on of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
they &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
it &apos;s possible .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
they were ma@@ turing at five centi@@ meters .
what we musi@@ cians do with our musical language is very alien to non-@@ profession@@ als .
and these two worl@@ ds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clas@@ hing with each other at the moment .
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the di@@ ving bell and the bu@@ tter@@ fly ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked ma@@ tter@@ -@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
and nobody seems to be making a f@@ uss about it .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
they actually make us worse off .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
a whi@@ pped cre@@ am dis@@ pen@@ ser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about for@@ ty to six@@ ty bar .
making it differently or pre@@ t@@ tier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
another example from a very different field . mon@@ et pain@@ ted his water@@ li@@ lies an infin@@ ite number of times .
priv@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c , a a bunch of ama@@ te@@ urs .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ o@@ spa@@ tial image .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , las@@ er surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , ti@@ tan@@ ium k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limit@@ s that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to cla@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global groups of their own choo@@ sing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest as@@ set .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infe@@ ction , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upp@@ er air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partner@@ ship between those percei@@ ved de@@ fi@@ ci@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
before we had a@@ wes@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
but you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new a@@ partment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facili@@ t@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether w@@ inning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ inning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my spor@@ ts vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experiment@@ al equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es secon@@ d@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stor@@ es .
it could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
i &apos;m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curi@@ osity and how curi@@ osity in turn trans@@ forms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curi@@ osity and need to give it a j@@ ol@@ t et ce@@ ter@@ a .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , vin@@ eg@@ ars , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contra@@ sting and actually pi@@ cking from that stun@@ ning display .
he only lived until the age of thir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness here .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were per@@ forming at a-@@ level .
henry , by contr@@ ast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on mar@@ ch 1 , 19@@ 80 .
and so , i really got bitten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean exploration .
then i would say , my warm con@@ dol@@ ences , you see ?
everybody needs a fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ i@@ cide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
so after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fi@@ ction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could re@@ build the organisation .
can i hand@@ le it directly or do i need a man@@ ual or a cor@@ respon@@ dent training .
so you &apos;re notic@@ ing a change is taking place , from a defen@@ sive at@@ titude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es is right .

and that was then it &apos;s not bin@@ ding , but it &apos;s yes , i think it has managed to become accep@@ ted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
at the next regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed ele@@ ction , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promis@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
two equ@@ ally large forces with opposite sign@@ s@@ natur@@ es will can@@ c@@ el each other out .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely trans@@ formed itself from a calcul@@ ator to a digital assi@@ stant .
climate skep@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely and relatively naturally .
they are ge@@ ared more towards the technical as well as the business aspe@@ cts of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
we &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le sent@@ ences for children .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ ver@@ sity as something more than just tough times .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the windows part , the dro@@ pp@@ er part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
at the media cam@@ pus , for example , we are attemp@@ ting to ren@@ der virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ five-@@ thir@@ ty percent ex@@ cess energy , so we have to li@@ mit the wind and sun .
i mean , how many of you saw the w@@ inning of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by ib@@ m &apos;s wat@@ son ?
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass is an ass that is made pur@@ ely of nature .
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
sure , i will have thro@@ wn some colors away too , but i will have ad@@ ded new ones to take their place .
if one person said no , there was the ve@@ to principle , which was totally de@@ moral@@ is@@ ing , for ten years , i i had gra@@ ve dou@@ b@@ ts as to whether i was perhaps really wa@@ sting my great engineering degree on something ridi@@ cul@@ ous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wa@@ sted your money on your child .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be .
and chicago just roll@@ ed it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
there is ad@@ ver@@ sity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ ver@@ sity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
and i began giving her my ra@@ p .
and you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a , polio ...
but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intui@@ tive ?
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
when i turn up in my little v@@ w cl@@ un@@ ker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
some of them are also regi@@ ster@@ ed together with the ha@@ cker@@ spaces , those places .
in many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
it &apos;s part of our life .
talk about getting by with nothing .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in it@@ al@@ y throw out a can of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a from their car window .
and this is a syndro@@ me called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syndro@@ me .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
because the plant in frank@@ fur@@ t would be the best at w@@ inning back phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and so , we started planning these and we wo@@ und up going to the bis@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehi@@ cles .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ ologist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on angi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ zi@@ ly did .
this is something that has to get to zero .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ecu@@ ting people . &quot;
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gras@@ ping .
and this tra@@ des under the names open knowledge and citi@@ zen science .
it was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
if we can do that , then instead of being tra@@ pped in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
seriously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
three times out of 10 .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the text@@ book .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare black@@ -@@ shoul@@ dered ki@@ te .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with c@@ uss words , then it was bush s@@ lan@@ ders and then people actually got to art .
here &apos;s their ja@@ m a@@ is@@ le .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of condu@@ ct .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accor@@ d@@ ingly in this , well , it &apos;s not really a gre@@ y area , but in this ro@@ se-@@ tin@@ ted area .
his name was dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an itali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
and how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
it would be easy to just throw a li@@ tr@@ e of waste oil onto it and the p@@ lot would be ru@@ ined for years .
all the dollars were allo@@ cated and extra tu@@ i@@ tion in english and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out , which was usually new clo@@ th@@ es ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
impli@@ c@@ it in this phr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
i was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sau@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ hed .
that our input to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
by not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hit@@ ter ?
so of course , random sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
and despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar called je@@ an bu@@ ri@@ dan , and bu@@ ri@@ dan &apos;s ass was named after him .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but used so-@@ called son@@ gl@@ ines , or dre@@ am@@ pa@@ ths
and you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , t@@ ar-@@ like fla@@ vor .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a transl@@ ator can &apos;t just simply ren@@ der a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation can occu@@ r .
and they didn &apos;t have phot@@ oli@@ th@@ ograph@@ y .
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , bio@@ ha@@ cking de@@ als with modern molecular biology .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
and this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ eline .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wra@@ pped in the ad@@ ver@@ sity .
and we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could imple@@ ment a reser@@ vo@@ ir wi@@ sely today .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predic@@ tors , you can &apos;t prove that .
if the di@@ v@@ ine , cock@@ e@@ yed geni@@ us as@@ sig@@ ned to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; o@@ le ! &quot;
and dr. p always wor@@ e really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
this is called a law of design or gest@@ alt psychology , which in turn affec@@ ts our perception .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
mark , mark , come back .
you know that healthy kind , when you betra@@ y a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
you know , nothing is possible in this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ au@@ rus back then .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of us@@ ability , so natural user inter@@ faces .
that is do@@ able .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
i thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
he rob@@ bed every o@@ un@@ ce of hope from my being .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
and i put in my motion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor@@ ial mis@@ condu@@ ct and police mis@@ condu@@ ct and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ condu@@ ct .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
you can he@@ ed the share by using one of these smart gri@@ ds , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &apos;ll never be able to do without the reser@@ vo@@ ir completely .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
explore .
this is &quot; the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors , &quot; based in the national g@@ aller@@ y .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ g@@ her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
and i had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
twice in one emergen@@ cy shift , i mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
these notes are about as pre@@ cise or im@@ pre@@ cise as the verb@@ al descri@@ ption of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely pre@@ cise .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
and that was really very , very bit@@ ter and then you end up in one of these ph@@ ases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutsch@@ mark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uni@@ form pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
but we found ourselves la@@ g@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually fo@@ unded the company to do .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
because you project an assu@@ mption that you &apos;re seeing something you re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ ise to the front , such as a circle .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ pl@@ asia .
and as soon as i walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
he s@@ mil@@ ed and said , oh ?
they gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ au@@ rus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
in in china a a cham@@ ber po@@ t is still called a hon@@ ey po@@ t , you could say , right ?
but each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
but just sub@@ stit@@ ute a@@ partment building for cities .
nam@@ ely to lie in such a way that you can simply imple@@ ment this lo@@ gic in the wrong way .
we have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le .
but , in the previous in@@ stances of those thes@@ au@@ rus ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
i can make b@@ ach &apos;s ton@@ al ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a b@@ aro@@ que har@@ p@@ sich@@ ord was not able to .
th@@ ank@@ fully many studies are being car@@ ried out on this top@@ ic .
... these do@@ sages have something to do with it .
the con@@ sequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
with the left they &apos;d just intui@@ tively gra@@ b it and then pass me the s@@ alt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .
under@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , exponenti@@ ally growing technologies .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ comes .
and if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
and then they start pil@@ ing up st@@ ones so your view is blo@@ cked .
it was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were ha@@ cked into .
i then tried to exp@@ and this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secon@@ d@@ hand equipment on e@@ bay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a pat@@ er@@ ni@@ ty test , so dna finger@@ prin@@ ting in other words , at home again .
in fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated more chemicals and divi@@ ded more .
o@@ pos@@ sum ? check . living ? ye@@ p .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
wher@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@ pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@ duced to ser@@ vi@@ tude and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the si@@ lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei@@ gh@@ ters hang light in the hori@@ zon ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
they are usually for@@ gotten by the third term .
i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ h@@ ill ski@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
of course this l@@ ends itself to a smart grid .
and then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
the act of kin@@ dness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i stri@@ ve to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
&quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
and , of course , the he@@ art@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but co@@ di@@ fy them through language .
go bo@@ ther leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot;
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prote@@ sts , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
so when kl@@ aus says , there is no sou@@ l .
we have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this country .
i was in a@@ we .
thre@@ ats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spi@@ ked .
do you want them dist@@ ressed ?
and for them language had in@@ fer@@ ior importance .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organis@@ ed two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shor@@ tly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the sus@@ pen@@ se .
they had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
o@@ le !
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no f@@ ame in it .
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic inje@@ ction ever .
this is harder to check or bring down .
we can &apos;t just do that .
tsun@@ ami war@@ ning . cyber@@ -@@ attac@@ ks .
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
a piece of music that is interpre@@ ted for the um@@ p@@ te@@ ent@@ h time is compar@@ able in this way .
like steve jobs once said : you need to dig deeper to understand how it works .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times sa@@ f@@ ely out of every 10 .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
suppose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surge@@ on who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
socie@@ tal deca@@ y . 65 dead .
and it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called black@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a .
you &apos;ll need some lo@@ gic here , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
and here &apos;s the thing .
that pro@@ ves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
the first two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
nice one .
and we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
that it comes to the human from outside .
what is decisi@@ ve , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s val@@ id .
i can cla@@ im anything .
according to which lo@@ gic do we dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , this will@@ ing@@ ness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is val@@ id in our un@@ conscious minds ?
but we know that if we were to say that out l@@ oud , social relationships will be sensi@@ tively dist@@ ur@@ bed .
the sou@@ l is something mental , lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z said .
so if you think of the google glas@@ ses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concep@@ ts that allows us to com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our aff@@ in@@ ity for virtu@@ al@@ is@@ ation , of experi@@ en@@ cing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being add@@ ressed again .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
by cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
but the concep@@ ts of the cy@@ ber age , they are re@@ turning these these possibilities to re@@ discover our abilities .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
and now our de@@ cep@@ tive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it here .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the sou@@ l exists or not .
we can apply these things to other examples .
a third theor@@ em which will turn up in people who have a strong atta@@ ch@@ ment to the idea of a sou@@ l .
also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
that has to do with us going back to the four@@ te@@ ent@@ h
they will say , a person who has no sou@@ l is dead and can &apos;t cla@@ im anything .
terrible .
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , such as non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
here this lo@@ gic is expres@@ sed in this de@@ cep@@ tive dis@@ course .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
that means that instead of having individual memor@@ ies , we have standar@@ dis@@ ed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memor@@ ies , onto which we can atta@@ ch our personal memor@@ ies .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
and if you think of this condition , then you &apos;ll understand the lo@@ gic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
failed wri@@ ter-@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic brand .
a young la@@ d like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fir@@ es .
and mor@@ e@@ over , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fir@@ es and are happy when the fire fl@@ ar@@ es up .
smart gri@@ ds are a hot top@@ ic at the moment everywhere .
those are the dec@@ lin@@ ing influ@@ ences of the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly an it@@ em in the daily new@@ spa@@ pers .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ement about what is val@@ id .
now we have the third theor@@ em .
there are other services like how we make ferti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
the first example works with the pres@@ um@@ ption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
here you have to keep another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a philosop@@ hi@@ cal slo@@ w-@@ bur@@ ner , close to hand .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
century .
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for re@@ moving the dan@@ ger that others create when they set a fire .
he &apos;s interested in setting fir@@ es .
you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence .
and they will they have been increasingly over@@ written during the course of the cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my pres@@ entation .
i can cla@@ im anything .
we had the age of feu@@ d@@ alism , we have had the machine age and we are now ste@@ pping into the so-@@ called cy@@ ber age .
this is about virtu@@ ality , about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , about story@@ telling .
there &apos;s no in@@ sur@@ ance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
we know that something else is really true .
here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
i would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illu@@ strate this .
so it atta@@ ches a third theor@@ em to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theor@@ em@@ s and only acts as if the opposite of the first theor@@ em had already been pro@@ ven and given pri@@ ority .
this this hin@@ t at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out l@@ oud .
because now you can imple@@ ment a rule of three .
and now you see the sou@@ l as having something of a cloud like nature , an air@@ y nature , it &apos;s called anim@@ a in la@@ tin , being like a breath of air .
but gradu@@ ally the written form became the primary medium , and ga@@ ined a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old .
and when this breath of air po@@ urs out onto a human , the human is filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with mind , with nature that can only live with a sou@@ l .
well there are opportunities all around us .
and then the fo@@ under of do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ self-@@ bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g came and said : okay
so you sense it already .
so we act as if it were impossible to live without a sou@@ l .
let &apos;s make a short pro@@ visi@@ onal app@@ rais@@ al .
the question is , what will come next ?
here you have the cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which swi@@ t@@ ches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
what &apos;s left is story@@ telling .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a lin@@ ear fashion .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
and &quot; o@@ le ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
this rule of three con@@ tains three theor@@ em@@ s .
we &apos;re still extremely atta@@ ched to story@@ telling as a method of information bro@@ ker@@ age .
and then it can leave you .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organis@@ ations , who are doing this more form@@ ally in an institu@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ ed form already .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le .
that sounds very spac@@ ey and like science fi@@ ction , i know .
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses the fact that two theor@@ em@@ s are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect and atta@@ ches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
i can say , the ger@@ man chan@@ cell@@ or is a man .
we no longer produce .
there are technical concep@@ ts such as “ aug@@ mented reality ” .
the first theor@@ em is , kl@@ aus cla@@ ims there is no sou@@ l .
and when you are with people who are fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or , you might say , who believe that the sou@@ l brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the sou@@ l is an in@@ corpo@@ real frame@@ work around you , and it &apos;s not material , and you are just made of fl@@ es@@ h and blood , are soli@@ d , so to speak , bo@@ und to the earth , ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al , subject to deca@@ y , in@@ significant , dead really .
you see it straight away .
it does not have a tan@@ gi@@ ble , material nature .
that here is bio@@ curious , the ha@@ cker@@ space i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education cent@@ re for for molecular biology .
i &apos;d like to explain that a little more .
but there are no associ@@ ations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
from the age of feu@@ d@@ alism to the to the machine age .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
we have an abstra@@ ct an abstra@@ cted language .
and has nothing more to do with reality .
lo@@ gic does not make any stat@@ ements about reality .
i &apos;m talking about the sou@@ l .
this is a rule of three , which descri@@ bes a lo@@ gic to us .
that &apos;s how people imagine the sou@@ l works .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “ scene ” , and we &apos;re online , and we we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting there and everything .
bru@@ ce brown , a famous design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet et@@ c. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memor@@ ies to stone and have ero@@ ded our ability to virtu@@ al@@ ise .
